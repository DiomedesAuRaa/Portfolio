## ðŸ”§ Professional Expertise

* **Cloud Architecture (AWS, Azure, GCP):** Designed hybrid/multi-cloud platforms, led on-prem â†’ cloud migrations, implemented HA/DR strategies, and tuned network security with Palo Alto, Juniper, and Cisco.
* **Automation & IaC:** Delivered Kubernetes platforms (EKS, GKE, AKS, RKE, K3s, OpenShift) with Terraform. Automated config with Ansible and built self-healing ops tooling in Bash and Python.
* **GitOps & ArgoCD:** Established GitOps workflows with **ArgoCD and Helm**, enabling consistent, auditable, and automated Kubernetes deployments across multiple environments.
* **Helm Chart Development:** Built reusable Helm charts and Go-templated manifests, integrated with CI/CD to deliver scalable, maintainable application releases.
* **Containerized & Serverless Workloads:** Delivered microservices and event-driven systems on **ECS, Cloud Run, and Azure Functions**, balancing performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency.
* **CI/CD:** Built pipelines with GitHub Actions, GitLab, Concourse, Jenkins, Spinnaker, and Azure DevOps, cutting release times from hours to minutes while reducing deployment risk.
* **Observability & Incident Response:** Rolled out Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager. Integrated with PagerDuty, Opsgenie, and ServiceNow to tighten alerting and reduce MTTR.
* **AI-driven Ops:** Leveraged AI-based tooling to optimize workflows, reduce toil, and improve incident response and observability.
* **Collaboration:** Advocated DevOps culture, built RBAC frameworks, and streamlined Agile delivery with Jira and cross-team workflows.
