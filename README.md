## 🔧 Core Expertise

- **Cloud Architecture (AWS, Azure, GCP):** Designed hybrid/multi-cloud systems, led on-prem → cloud migrations, implemented HA/DR strategies, and secured networks with Palo Alto, Juniper, and Cisco.  
- **Infrastructure as Code & Automation:** Delivered production-grade Kubernetes platforms (EKS, GKE, AKS, RKE, K3s, OpenShift) with Terraform. Automated configuration with Ansible and built self-healing ops tooling in Bash and Python.  
- **GitOps & ArgoCD:** Established end-to-end GitOps workflows using ArgoCD and Helm for consistent, auditable, and automated deployments across environments.  
- **Helm Chart Development:** Built reusable, Go-templated Helm charts integrated with CI/CD pipelines for scalable and maintainable releases.  
- **Containerized & Serverless Workloads:** Delivered microservices and event-driven systems on ECS, Cloud Run, and Azure Functions, optimizing for performance and cost.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Engineered pipelines with GitHub Actions, GitLab, Concourse, Jenkins, Spinnaker, and Azure DevOps — cutting deployment times from hours to minutes.  
- **Observability & Incident Response:** Rolled out Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager. Integrated Opsgenie, PagerDuty, and ServiceNow to reduce MTTR and improve alert quality.  
- **AI/ML Infrastructure:** Designed GPU-enabled Kubernetes and cloud environments for scalable model training and inference. Leveraged AI-driven observability and automation to optimize performance and reduce toil.  
- **Security & Governance:** Implemented secret management with Vault, KMS, and cloud-native Secret Managers. Applied FinOps practices for cost visibility, security, and optimization across multi-cloud environments.  
- **DevOps Culture:** Advocated strong collaboration frameworks, RBAC governance, and Agile delivery with Jira and cross-functional workflows.
