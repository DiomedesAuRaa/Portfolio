Still impressive how constantly good and a dynasty they’ve become, won’t be shocked to see them here again next year.\n\nMassive credit to Blaha, the dude was absolutely the best player on the field tonight- able to move, incredible passes, taking advantage of his big WRs with the ball placement? Couldn’t ask for more. And, ya know, casually beating Joe Burrow’s 2019 yardage record… amazing. An absolute banger of a Stagg Bowl, and HUGE congrats to UWRF!!! Welcome to D3 history!!!",

The rule basically only exists to keep low-average high-power pull hitters in the league. I say teach those losers how to bunt, but my petty grievances are besides the point. We’re not just unbanning the shift here, we’re going a step further to (near) totally positionless baseball. The proposed rule change is as follows:\n\nThe fielding team must field a minimum of one pitcher, all other fielders may assume the position of their choice.\n\nThe possibilities for this rule are endless. One pitcher and eight 2nd basemen? Have at it. Eight catchers behind the plate? Go nuts. However, despite all of the fun conceptual fielding setups you could attempt, the real development brought about by this rule change would be the multi pitcher setup.\n\nI’ve [created a diagram](https://i.imgur.com/QWq4VLo.png) outlining the changes to the field that would need to occur. Each red dot on the rubber is a designated pitching spot, where the first pitcher starts in the middle, and all subsequent pitchers get filled in by choosing the next available dot closest to the center. This way, if you want the added benefit of having say a sidearm left reliever pitching to a left handed hitter from basically behind the hitter's back, you would need to field a minimum of eight pitchers to get him in that spot.\n\nThere are a few additional rules that need to be added to make sure the balance of the game stays intact.\n\nAll pitches must be released before the first pitch reaches the plate (if failed the batter gets an automatic walk)\nA four+ ball count overrides a three+ strike count (i.e. if three pitchers throw two balls and one strike on a 2-2 count, the batter walks if they don’t swing)\nA pitch attempt will be considered a passed ball if the catcher fails to catch one strike (this will be important later)\n\nThe rationale behind these rules is to balance things slightly back towards the batter. Forcing the pitchers to throw in tandem requires a high level of coordination, especially as you get beyond two or three guys on the mound. Additionally, if you would like to get the benefit of having eight grown men hurling a 90+ MPH projectile at a batter at the same time, you have to make sure at least five of them hit the strike zone. The most important rule to the success of this new project is the passed ball change. If you do gain the advantage of having multiple pitchers, you then have to deal with a catcher who also has eight grown men hurling a 90+ MPH projectile at them, with the added challenge of having to identify a strike to catch while presumably being pelted by most if not all of the other pitches. And of course, all of this will necessitate having a fully implemented ABS system (god forbid watching C.B. Bucknor try and call a correct count with a half dozen pitches thrown).\n\nWith all that out of the way, let's get into the potential strategies to be used by teams if this rule change were applied for the 2026 season.\n\n#1: The Three Strike Approach.\n\nThis one is a nice balance between the old school ‘single pitcher’ form of baseball and some of our more radical alignments we’ll get into later. As shown [here](https://i.imgur.com/QTSq8xH.png), the fielding setup will consist of three pitchers, a catcher, two infielders, two outfielders, and a 1800s style “shortstop” playing a shallow OF. There are quite a few benefits to this system, the first being that unless you hit a batter, your team can strike out a player on the first pitch, but cannot walk them on the first pitch. Additionally, unlike some other setups, you still have a decent fielding core to cover any potential balls in play. On top of all of this, you don’t need a roster that is all pitchers to sustain this system, allowing you to maybe get some of your own hits every once in a while. Imagine having Trey Yesavage in the middle, and a sidearm lefty/righty flanking him on either side! I think this would be the best possible alignment, but it definitely wouldn’t be the most fun.\n\n#2: Eight Man Assault\n\nAs alluded to earlier, the fear induced by having eight pitchers on the mound would be huge. However, the drawbacks are immediately obvious and hard to overcome. Eight pitchers pitching means eight pitchers batting, against a team that is also most likely putting more than one guy on the mound. There are going to be a LOT of 0-0 extra innings snooze fests. The passed ball issue is going to come into play here as well, with the catcher becoming more of a goalie looking to knock down any ball to then throw to the left-most pitcher who now has to cover first base every time. \n\nThe biggest issue is arm durability, given the fact that a roster only has 26 slots. Thankfully, we can mitigate this by playing to the strengths of having eight pitchers on the mound, and specifically draft and train players who pitch at a much slower velocity that can throw a complete game daily with ease. Having three or four of these guys on the roster will allow us to stock a few flamethrowers, some “normal” starters who can rotate through while they toss 55 MPH fastballs for nine innings every day. Plus, with good team coordination, you can have them release first and the “real” pitcher release with a slight delay so that all pitches arrive at the plate around the same time despite the velocity difference, which would certainly be a challenge for the hitter.\n\nThere is also the issue of ball traffic. With two pitchers it's a rare but possible scenario that two pitches hit each other and redirect wildly. With eight pitchers, it's an inevitability. This will add to the batters fear level, but also lead to a lot more HBP’s and straight up walks. Plus, with a player on base, you are forced to either shift alignments or give up the inevitable 1st-to-3rd steal on the next pitch. This one has very situational use cases, but likely is not viable for more than a few hitters per game.\n\n#3: First Base\n\nPut eight guys at first base because you can now. Maybe they just hate their pitcher and want to hang him out to dry. I just thought it’d be funny to see eight major leaguers standing in a circle around first, giggling about how their pitcher is giving up a dozen inside the park home runs an inning.\n\n#4: Felony Assault\n\nNine pitchers. No catchers. No fielders. The incentive to follow the unwritten rules becomes much more important when the opposing team can legally put you up against a proverbial firing squad. When you run out onto the field with no catchers, there is no question of intent. You are signalling to the opposing batter that you will be hitting them, and with nine guys throwing you can bet that at least a few of them will land. Potentially illegal in real life, but maybe worth it if you really hate a guy enough. \n\nThat about sums things up. If you like the idea of this rule change, make sure to contact the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball and pester them until they listen, and of course, I’d love to hear about other potential positional alignments that could be tried here.",

We obviously have newcomers and new ICE regulations, so we expect some initial differentiation,”\n\n“But we also believe that we’ve also put in place procedures to, let’s say, enable people to gradually catch up. So we believe that it’s a temporary matter in terms of performance differentiations.\n\n“Then we have completely new aerodynamic regulations as well. Naturally, there will be some solutions that are better and some that are worse. There will be some initial convergence, I guess, over the first six months or one year.”\n\n# F1 2026 end expected to be ‘closer’ than 2025 – Tombazis\n\nThe last major regulation change came about in 2014, when the V6 hybrid era was fully introduced, and saw some sizeable gaps in competitiveness across the grid.\n\nThis has led to inevitable concern that a similar eventuality will transpire, but while Tombazis expects there to be some gulfs early on, he believes the season will end potentiall more competitive than the 2025 campaign.\n\n“For 2026, I would not expect to have the grid quite as close as what we had last year,” he said. “But I would expect that the converged grid \\[later on\\] is closer than what it was in 2025.”\n\nIt appears that progress across the grid has been made already, with Pirelli reporting that its second round of simulator testing saw results much closer between all teams compared to the first.\n\nTombazis is therefore somewhat confident but cautious about just how close the grid from top to bottom will be.\n\n“Reasonably, but we cannot be sure because we don’t have detailed data from the teams, so we don’t know how much downforce they have now or how much horsepower they have,” he said.\n\n“Initially, I think there may be some variation, but we are pretty sure that the converged performance should lead to a smaller \\[more compact\\] grid.”\n\nOf course, gaps in speed between teams could, from the perspective of some fans, form a lack of entertainment factor for them, but Tombazis pointed out that this will not be an issue.\n\n“I think what determines the closeness of the grid is not necessarily the gap between the first and the last,” he explained.\n\n“If one or two teams are in a bit of trouble initially, I don’t think that determines how exciting a championship is.\n\n“Usually that’s determined by how close, let’s say, the people in the top half are, so the teams battling for points and wins. And I think there we will have a reasonably close field.”",

An experience where I was trying to figure out what was going on, still knowing I was in season. So I thought it would be smart to talk to someone. So I go to the building where I spend most of my calendar year, the football facility. I thought I would receive guidance and clarity, as it was a life-changing experience.

The fact of the matter is, the deep bench that allows us to plug and play whoever’s skill set is needed at any point in time is what gives us  an advantage over most other teams. (And those teams don’t have Cade)\n\nWhat happens when we got against a team with amazing interior defense like Cleveland? We sub in players like Dannis to bomb them from outside\n\nWhat happens when the other team is a bit older and slow? Ivey speeds past everyone and hits a ton of easy transition lays \n\nWhat about when the starting lineup is off all together ? Sasser gets his own bucket off the dribble \n\nObviously there are more situations where players like BBall Paul and Levert shine (although Levert has been off lately) but remeber Levert is 38% from three this season. \n\nWe are young. Our window is HUGE as long as Cade and Duren are here. Everyone on this team understands their roles and are ready to play any given night and don’t complain to the media when they are a healthy scratch. They understand that some nights aren’t going to be theirs. They play hard defensively no matter what the score is.This is the team others dream of. No reason to mess it up for an offensive player who takes away from the defensive identity of the team and makes others work even harder to compensate their lack of defensive focus. ",

Maye is going to get a very well deserved 2nd team all pro. I don’t even mean that sarcastically he really has had a great season.\n\nYou’d think pats fans would be looking ahead to their game this weekend and being all excited about idk trying to go win a Super Bowl?",

It’s not just an easy schedule. It’s a historical outlier. That’s why it’s being mentioned. It’s never been a point in decades because a schedule has never been this level of easy. \n\n1-2 against .500 teams. \n\nDidn’t play literally any of the top 15 defenses apart from Cleveland. No Seattle, Eagles, Chiefs, Lions, broncos, Texans, Rams, Vikings defenses which are all the best in league. \n\nPlayed the 2 outlier teams (Raiders and Jets) who were historically bad, 3 times. \n\nNearly 1/4 of Maye’s passing td’s came against the 2 x Jets games. The second game where the defense with 14 defensive injuries is probably the worst defense in NFL history (jets the last month of the season). \n\nStafford also had the 7th most passing TD’s in nfl history facing 8 teams .500 or better. \n\nThey had the No.1 HARDEST schedule in the league and the Pats had the easiest schedule in the last 832 schedules (26 years). Thats why it’s been brought up.",
