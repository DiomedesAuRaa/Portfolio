That means other schools had a three week head start (I know the rules but let’s not be naive).

Will it be every player who has entered the portal? No. \n\n* CREAM seems to be in effect: I’m genuinely excited about the staff Whitt has assembled and I think if the money is equal we have a chance to retain any player in the portal… but the money won’t be equal.
