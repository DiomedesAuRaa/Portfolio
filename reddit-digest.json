I played scout team offense on his side of the practice field for several years - its not a plug and play system. It takes a lot of mental reps and thinking for his defense to succeed. So why bother sticking around to learn a defensive system when you can just transfer somewhere else to play and not have to worry about all of that. He is also really really tough (but fair). Which works as a head coach - since you answer to no one - but as a coordinator you have to make sure the head coach is OK with it. In today's game where players hit the portal if their feelings get hurt, can he be as hard nosed as he wants to be while still keeping players around?\n\nI love him to death but this isn't 2010 anymore (and its why I absolutely hate the current state of college football)",

Over this stretch KAT has put up 17/10/3 on 43/32/85 shooting splits as a 7' tall center, and on the season he has been mediocre or worse from every distance.\n\nKnicks team defense has been beyond atrocious, and when watching the games you get the feeling the players don't want to put in more than 20 minutes worth of effort a game.\n\nMike Brown rarely challenges calls, stands on the sidelines with his hands in his pockets, and jokes around with opposing players as the Knicks lose. Great example was when he was laughing with Draymond Green right after Draymond purposely grabbed the ankle of KAT on a play.\n\nBrunson played 7 of these games and has been as good as usual, so nobody can blame this awful stretch just on him missing time. As a side note, Yabusele might be the worst player in the league but that hasn't stopped Mike Brown from giving him play time.",

There's two testing streams from this past weekend from \"The Roar Before the 24\" on this channel, which is where you will also find the race stream next weekend.
