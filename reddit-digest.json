He says having a 100 OPS+ on the Pirates is not the same as having a 100 OPS+ on the Yankees or Dodgers. \n\nThe reasoning largely has to do with quality of opposition & how playing for a bad team (or with Pittsburgh in particular a bad lineup but good pitching) means you’re more likely to face better pitching later in games because you play in more close games to begin with. \n\nThey speak to an unnamed exec who basically validates Pham’s theory. They say most team models do incorporate this stuff & the impact isn’t huge or anything but it’s a legit take.\n\nHe also specifically calls out Jose Ramirez, says his numbers are being suppressed by playing for Cleveland, & that he wants to see weather-related variables integrated into defensive metrics.",

        "selftext": "Translation:\n\n\"Pérez: \"At Red Bull, everything was a problem\"\n\nSergio Pérez described how the Red Bull team has exclusively focused on Max Verstappen over the past few seasons.\n\nAs Sergio Pérez prepares his return to Formula 1 with Cadillac, he has once again criticized the peculiar way the Red Bull team, where he spent four seasons (2021-2024), operates. In the [Oso Trava](https://youtu.be/X7JshNb717k?si=qvCxg3qQMXxY66BJ) podcast, he elaborated on the exclusivity his former team granted to Max Verstappen and his feeling that he was never able to satisfy his employer, regardless of his performance level.\n\n*\"The team complained about everything ,\"* the Mexican driver asserted. *\"At Red Bull, everything was a problem. **If I was faster, it was a problem and it created a very tense environment. If I was slower than Max, that was also a problem.** I understood that these were the circumstances I was working in and, instead of complaining, I tried to make the best of it.\"*\n\n*\"I knew what I was getting into at Red Bull. **During my first discussion with Christian [Horner], he told me: 'We're going to race with two cars because we have to have two cars, but this project was created for Max, he's our talent.'** I was in the best team, a very complicated team. **Being Max's teammate is already very difficult, but being Max's teammate at Red Bull is the worst job in Formula 1.**\"*\n\nSacked at the end of the 2024 season, Sergio Pérez did not leave Red Bull on bad terms and never spoke ill of his former team, instead seeking to explain the situation he found himself in. When Christian Horner chose to replace him with Liam Lawson, who was himself demoted after two Grands Prix in favor of Yuki Tsunoda, Sergio Pérez sensed that the Milton Keynes team principal was not convinced.\n\n*\"At that moment, I said to him, 'Christian, what are you going to do when it doesn't work out with Liam?' He replied that there was Yuki. 'And what are you going to do when it doesn't work out with Yuki?' He replied, 'We have a lot of drivers.' I told him he was going to use them all and he said, 'Yes, I know.'\"*\n\nSince then, the situation at Red Bull has changed dramatically, with the successive departures of Christian Horner and Helmut Marko. Now led by Laurent Mekies, the team has chosen a new teammate for Max Verstappen for 2026. It remains to be seen whether the conditions will have changed and will allow Isack Hajjar to continue in a second seat that has become cursed in recent months.\"",

        "selftext": "As seismic as Ruben Amorim’s defenestration at Manchester United might seem, it is firmly on-brand for owners who specialise in promising the earth and delivering nothing more than a few savings on Sellotape. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his Ineos politburo have long shown their sureness of touch as football masterminds, whether in extending Erik ten Hag’s contract and sacking him three months later, or in paying Newcastle £4m for the services of “best in class” Dan Ashworth and jettisoning him after 15 league games.\n\nNow Amorim, a man whom Ratcliffe predicted this year would stay at Old Trafford “for a long time”, has discovered that the billionaire’s assurances are about as concrete as fairy dust. Ratcliffe might be admired within his petrochemicals empire for his plain speaking, but at United his only distinguishing attribute is to say one thing and do another. Here is the figure who, in a recent interview, gave Amorim three years to prove himself. That promise has not even lasted three months. Once the Ferrari of football, United are now a clown car.\n\nFor a man who insists he is following a coherent strategy, Ratcliffe has shown through his treatment of Amorim that he is susceptible to panic. Plus, he appears to have no instinct for when to pull the trigger. The time for dismissing Amorim was after last year’s Europa League final in Bilbao, where United succumbed feebly to a dreadful Tottenham side. Instead, Ratcliffe backed him to the tune of £225m in the summer transfer window, watched him claw the team to the cusp of Champions League qualification this season, only to scrap the entire project at the first signs of a power struggle, with no blueprint for how to start afresh.\n\nHistory might not repeat itself, or so the saying goes, but it often rhymes. And there is a distinct echo in Amorim’s fate of what happened to Ten Hag, retained when Ratcliffe allowed the emotion of an FA Cup triumph to cloud his better judgment but kicked to the curb as soon as United’s league form went south once more. This circular pattern, where Ratcliffe plays the tough guy but loses his nerve at the truly consequential moments, threatens to erode faith among supporters in his methods.\n\nIneos have burned through eight managers during their six years running Nice in Ligue 1, with some of those let go subsequently enjoying much success elsewhere. Francesco Farioli, for example, has since proved his credentials at both Ajax and Porto. It hardly says much about Ineos’ capacity for identifying and retaining talent in football. In the same way as Scott McTominay, the midfielder somehow considered surplus to requirements, has since torn up trees for Napoli, you would not bet against Amorim, still one of Europe’s most precocious managers at 40, re-establishing his reputation in a less dysfunctional set-up.\n\nWhen you reflect on this saga, perhaps the most extraordinary detail is United’s surprise at the manager that Amorim turned out to be. Ratcliffe prised him from Sporting Lisbon in the first place, knowing full well that he was a headstrong personality wedded to a rigid tactical system. And yet now he has cast him aside for the very same reasons. An impression grows that Ratcliffe, for all his staggering business successes, has not the faintest conception of how to put the listing United supertanker back on an even keel. For fans hoping fervently for a turning of the page, Amorim’s exit signals less a masterstroke than another desperate stab in the dark.",

(And those teams don’t have Cade)\n\nWhat happens when we got against a team with amazing interior defense like Cleveland? We sub in players like Dannis to bomb them from outside\n\nWhat happens when the other team is a bit older and slow? Ivey speeds past everyone and hits a ton of easy transition lays \n\nWhat about when the starting lineup is off all together ? Sasser gets his own bucket off the dribble \n\nObviously there are more situations where players like BBall Paul and Levert shine (although Levert has been off lately) but remeber Levert is 38% from three this season. \n\nWe are young. Our window is HUGE as long as Cade and Duren are here. Everyone on this team understands their roles and are ready to play any given night and don’t complain to the media when they are a healthy scratch. They understand that some nights aren’t going to be theirs. They play hard defensively no matter what the score is.This is the team others dream of. No reason to mess it up for an offensive player who takes away from the defensive identity of the team and makes others work even harder to compensate their lack of defensive focus. ",
