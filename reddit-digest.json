        "selftext": "Hélène Hendriks does not have fond memories of Diego Costa. The former Atlético Madrid striker behaved rudely during an interview in the coronavirus era.\n\n\n\nHendriks was a reporter during the Champions League round of 16 match between Liverpool and Atlético (2-3) in March 2020. While the Netherlands was already in lockdown, the stadium was still full. “In the end, 41 of the people who were in that stadium died of COVID-19,” Hendriks said in the HNM podcast.\n\n\n\nAfter the match, Hendriks conducted interviews. “First I had Virgil van Dijk, then Diego Costa came. Do you know what Diego Costa did? He walked up and deliberately coughed in the face of everyone standing there.” The presenter found the striker's action distasteful. “I don't get angry easily, but I wanted to run after him and say, ‘What are you doing to me?’”\n\n\n\n“He coughed right in my face,” emphasizes Hendriks, who was not wearing a face mask at the time. “But I was attached to a wire for the connection with the Netherlands, and I was walking behind Diego Costa, so the whole camera fell over. I didn't know what had happened to me. I thought it was outrageous.” Two days later, Hendriks had the coronavirus, she says. “What a jerk! What an asshole!” says Noa Vahle.\n\n\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)",
