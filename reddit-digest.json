They’ve never struck gold but always had a ‘pretty good’ team and a good system for players. Last year showed it and Joe was part of that.. \n\nIt’s easy to look at the stats and say he’s the only one trying.\n\nEdit - For what it’s worth, I think they should have got rid of insight personally as he’s shown to be inconsistent for years.",
