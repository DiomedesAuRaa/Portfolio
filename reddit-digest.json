Someone made a post about it a day ago, but they transitioned to a passing offense relying on deeper routes/ more 7 step drops than last year. It seems odd to do this when you are also breaking in a new center.\n\n3. The Ragnow “un-retirement ” and how it went down. I think the team was expecting him to just come back in 2025, and Rags felt bad going back on his word so he tried to flip the switch when he saw them struggling. He likely gets hurt ramping up which is how the hamstring issue happened.\n\nMy guess is at some point after the 2024 season  Ragnow had changed his mind but the wheels were already in motion - draft and FA had happened so team had to deal with what they had.\n\nI also think Ragnow has been 50/50 on coming back in 2026, but if my theory is true the team will prepare as if they don’t expect him back, meaning either Rat at C or a notable free agent pickup (it’s incredibly rare for a rookie to start at Center so I don’t see that either).",
