What am I missing?\n\nAnd btw I’m not asking for some corporate social justice slop from the league. But this is serious and for them to not even acknowledge a report alleging that an owner is defying international law/sanctions is mind boggling to me\n\nEDIT: here is a link to Hunterbrook’s investigation/the allegations I reference above:  [https://hntrbrk.com/ubiquiti/](https://hntrbrk.com/ubiquiti/)",

We have not yet seen his address to the world, but we take these matters very seriously, and we will investigate.” \n\nWhen it comes to the head office, the league are basically lawyers protecting the business interests of _all_ the owners. So not until it becomes embarrassing to other owners will they say anything. \n\nA couple of owners may have no problem with what Pera’s ~~drone~~ company is doing all with the equipment that’s ending up in Russia. \n\nI’ll admit that I didn’t watch the Pablo videos on Pera, but just have the general jist of it. \n\nThough I bet he seems know federal inquiry about violating sanctions against Russia, I bet he gets a call from the White House (and maybe even the Mavericks owners) about violating sanctions against Iran.",

Section 401, row 6 is listed at $16.00. That turns into $17.75 at checkout with a vague “service fee” on a digital ticket I’ll have in seconds. Rays add a $17 service fee on top of the face value of a $99 resale ticket. Astros add a $16.49 service fee. They’ll add 20% as a service fee to every ticket they sell, maybe to “run the platform” but not in a way that keeps the scalpers and bots from grabbing every ticket within seconds. The whole damn live entertainment industry is crooked as hell and only stops when states pass laws to try to stop them. \n\n> Although the team stopped charging these fees by July 2024, after the passage of a California state law prohibiting them, “they have not refunded fans the millions of dollars in Junk Fees that those fans have been charged,” the suit says.\n\n>The named plaintiff in the case, Juan Flores, bought two tickets for a game between the Giants and Padres in March 2024 that were advertised as costing $10 apiece. Once he got to the checkout page, additional “convenience” and “processing” fees were added, the suit says, upping the total price to $29—a 45% increase over what was advertised.",

I’m sure that’s the mindset, but tackling is about getting all the way there, wrapping the guy—thudding the guy, wrapping him—and then you just don’t got to do the extra bring him to the ground, right? Half the time, guys are just in desperation trying to get somebody on the ground where you’re putting yourself and the person who you’re tackling at risk, right? That’s improper tackling technique, but if you’re doing it correctly, you can be in a position where you can tackle and be like, ‘Okay, I ain’t bringing you all the way to the ground.’”",

No Haliburton, No Tatum, Giannis maybe changing teams, Knicks and Cavs look beatable.\n\nIn my opinion we should be buyers at the deadline and really try to improve the roster. Maybe not a major move but we need more perimeter shooting badly.",

Come playoff time we will need a secondary shot creator and hopefully one who can make high volume 3s…Not a better time than now to strike while the East is weak with Haliburton, Tatum and essentially Giannis out of the way. \n\nHold the fort and love this team as constructed, yes, however don’t be crushed and whining when Cade is constantly overwhelmed and we rely solely on Duncan Robinson to bail us out from our shooting woes. Trajan saw last postseason where Beasley became obsolete and Cade was pressured immensely, he will add the piece or pieces needed to give us an actual shot at winning the championship, which is an actual reality but not as constructed….wait until next season when Green, Reed dip to get some more deserved money and all of a sudden this team isn’t as deep. We can win this year if we play our cards right, I say go for it because the cost isn’t actually that much to make it happen. We have 14.1 in trade exception and all our firsts and a dozen 2 rounders to make this a reality.",
