In game six of that series Embiid hyperextends his knee after he tries a put back dunk.\n\nSecond round we find our selves against the Knicks. We go down 0-2. Embiid comes back in a a brace and we somehow win two in a row. Then we split the next two. Game seven we lose by 15 in msg. Embiid has 16 points 6 rebounds. Maxey and VJ shoot 2-16 from deep. Brunson has 42 points. Mikal bridges mom continues to get revenge. \n\nIf only Embiid was healthy we would’ve made the conference finals, so we’ll try again next year where he’ll finally be healthy.",

Lower minutes, games off at any sign of discomfort, a supporting cast that doesn’t need him to play injured or risk being a lottery team. \n\nStill more realistic he gets hurt but he’s never been given this much ability to slowly, very slowly ramp into a season.",

I mean, many fans and media members didn’t think he could get back to even this level of play. He’s not as impactful on defense these days, but he still has such remarkable touch and skill. I’m happy for Joel and hope he’s able to stay healthy. I think it’s important that the entire load of the team doesn’t rely on him offensively anymore.",
