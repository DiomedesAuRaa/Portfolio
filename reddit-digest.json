        "selftext": "Hélène Hendriks does not have fond memories of Diego Costa. The former Atlético Madrid striker behaved rudely during an interview in the coronavirus era.\n\n\n\nHendriks was a reporter during the Champions League round of 16 match between Liverpool and Atlético (2-3) in March 2020. While the Netherlands was already in lockdown, the stadium was still full. “In the end, 41 of the people who were in that stadium died of COVID-19,” Hendriks said in the HNM podcast.\n\n\n\nAfter the match, Hendriks conducted interviews. “First I had Virgil van Dijk, then Diego Costa came. Do you know what Diego Costa did? He walked up and deliberately coughed in the face of everyone standing there.” The presenter found the striker's action distasteful. “I don't get angry easily, but I wanted to run after him and say, ‘What are you doing to me?’”\n\n\n\n“He coughed right in my face,” emphasizes Hendriks, who was not wearing a face mask at the time. “But I was attached to a wire for the connection with the Netherlands, and I was walking behind Diego Costa, so the whole camera fell over. I didn't know what had happened to me. I thought it was outrageous.” Two days later, Hendriks had the coronavirus, she says. “What a jerk! What an asshole!” says Noa Vahle.\n\n\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)",

        "selftext": "Full Statement:\n\nLothar Matthäus on Lennart Karl's statement of Real Madrid being his dream club: \"I think it's great when someone has self-confidence even at 17. Setting goals has absolutely nothing to do with arrogance. I find it honest, but not pretentious or arrogant. Real Madrid simply has that kind of mystique. Bayern Munich is in a similar position, but often you want to try something new in life. You can't say, \"I'll stay at Bayern my whole life,\" like Thomas Müller – that's unique. Ultimately, everyone has a goal at some point.\n\nI think it's all fine. It shows that Karl is ambitious and believes in himself. He knows he has to perform exceptionally well at Bayern to even be on Real Madrid's radar. He hasn't said he wants to play for Real in the next two years. It's his dream. Dreams can come true, but you have to work for them, and Bayern would benefit from that. If Karl becomes so good that Real Madrid negotiates with him, he'll first have to achieve something extraordinary at another club [Bayern].\n\nI, too, would have loved to play for Real Madrid. I was named World Player of the Year in 1990/91, and suddenly Real Madrid were knocking on my door. I would have loved to go, but I still had a contract. That's why the transfer didn't work out back then. Real and I had an agreement, but Inter didn't want to let me go for a high transfer fee. I, too, had dreams: I always said that I wanted to play for a big club, become a national team player, and be part of the World Cup squad. At some point, dreams just get bigger. Four years ago, Karl probably would have said that he wanted to play in the Bundesliga – probably for Bayern Munich.\n\nKarl simply sees what's possible. It's not just about the sporting aspect. It's also about a new, different, and better quality of life, better weather, the biggest club in the world. And we've often seen that the best footballers in the world don't come from the Bundesliga, but rather from a league that receives more global attention.\"",
