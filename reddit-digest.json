Its been reported the Mets offer for Tucker was in the same ballpark as LA's, but if the money is even, why not go play where you can win a ring in nice weather and hang out with movie stars? Its like if the Lakers were as stacked as the Thunder, what player wouldn't want to go there?\n\nThey just have every advantage possible, all at the same time, to a degree that really only the most dominant Yankee dynasties of the past ever came close to matching.",

        "selftext": "I've been following Kyle Whittingham since he was an assistant at Utah, and I can tell you what you will get with his defenses. Jay Hill is a disciple of his, and they have essentially the same philosophy.\n\n\\- The #1 thing you will likely hear them talk about is making the other team one-dimensional. The basic philosophy is getting big, block-eating defensive tackles to eat up blocks and allow linebackers to stop the run. Once they give up on the run, turn up the volume and force the QB to make good decisions under pressure.\n\n\\- Challenge the offense by trusting our defensive backs to win 1 v 1 matchups with their receivers while we hound the QB.\n\nTo make this work we NEED our defensive tackles to do their job and/or the linebackers to be good enough to cover for their deficiencies. Last year, Utah had neither of those at the end of the year (the DTs were too light and inexperienced, and two of the linebackers had been severely injured in previous years and lost a step), and we were worse than I've ever seen a defense be under Kyle Whittingham.\n\nAs long as we have guys that can plug up running gaps (DTs or LBs) we will have, at minimum, a top 30 defense.\n\nMy question for you is, who do we have that will make this kind of defense work?",

Obviously a spouse is going to stick up for her man, but Graham’s wife on Twitter all but confirmed he was healthy enough to play, despite what we were told. He’s not a good center, but we would have been in a better position.\n\nMarcus Davenport playing over 50% of defensive snaps when he came back was another one. I actually liked what I saw from him last year, but this year he was a total non-factor. I know AQM can be a liability in the run game, but we were getting gashed in must-win games anyway—so at that point, who really cares?\n\nAidan Hutchinson playing well over 90% of the snaps every game was wild. Most people weren’t expecting a world-beater opposite Hutch, but having some young depth felt like a realistic expectation that just didn’t happen. That’s an insane workload, and it’s honestly crazy how good of shape he had to be in to stay as effective as he was.\n\nChristian Mahogany didn’t look right when he came back from injury. In his first game back he got banged up pretty good and looked extremely ineffective. It would’ve been nice to see Miles Frazier out there, especially considering how flippant the staff seemed about subbing OL starters in must-win games.\n\nJamo for the first few games. Enough said.\n\nOverall, there was a lot of head-scratching stuff. Not like I know better, but in hindsight you start to notice some weird decisions. What really struck me was how often the coaching staff asked players to do things they clearly weren’t good at—minimal adjustment when safeties went out, slow-developing pulls on the OL, etc. Any others I’m missing?",

        "selftext": "During the closing minutes of the game last night against Phoenix, tension was expressed by many fans on the Pistons sub and some Pistons fan site, even Greg and George, that the Pistons would let the game slip away. Cade, visibly still bothered by an injury, was missing free throws. So were his other teammates. The Suns were not going down without a fight.\n\nBut I found myself relaxed while I was watching. It's because I looked at the score and I computed in my head \"Phoenix will not reach 110 pts. The Pistons got this.\"\n\nThe Pistons scored just 108 points last night, 8 points below the league average of 116 pts per game this season. Including last night's game, the Pistons played 6 games where they scored 108 points or less. They split those games, winning three, and losing three.\n\nWhat is more interesting for me, though, is the other side of the equation. Phoenix scored just 105 points last night. In the 39 games so far this season, the Pistons have limited their opponents to 105 points or less ten times, of which they lost only once. That would be the previous game against the Clippers when Cade, Duren, Stew, and Tobias were all out.\n\nWhich leads me to another fun observation. The Pistons have not lost in fourteen games so far this season where Cade played and their opponents were limited to 111 points or below. Basically when Cade plays and the team's defense shows up, it has been an auto win this season.\n\nLast night, Cade played his most horrific scoring game so far this season. Inefficient Cade is not a recipe for success. In the six games this season where Cade had a horrible true shooting percentage below 50%, the Pistons have only won twice.\n\nBut then again, there is another stat showing that the Pistons won almost 80% of the games when Cade hit double digit assists, which happened in 19 out of 39 games so far.\n\nSo what is the point of my rambling? Nothing really sophisticated. LOL. I guess I just want to argue that if the Pistons do upgrade the offense this season before the trade deadline, I sincerely hope they do not do it at the expense of 1) the elite defense and 2) Cade's elite playmaking that made this miraculous turnaround and gave the team its identity. So please, no CJ Mccollum or Colin Sexton or heck even Lauri Markkanen who is currently having the worst defensive season of his career. An offensive upgrade is needed by the Pistons but it should not make the team lose its winning identity that has been built on defense.\n\nThe Alex Caruso for Josh Giddey trade comes to mind. When that trade came about, a lot in reddit and in the mainstream media were highlighting that Caruso addressed a weakness which was Giddey's 3P shooting. The funny twist is that after the trade, Giddey became the much better three point shooter than Alex. LOL. But the Caruso trade did work out for OKC not because Alex plugged the team's weakness in three point shooting but rather because his acquisition was the Thunder doubling down on the team's already elite defense.\n\nThe Nuggets this season is another example. They have accepted that their team's strength is on offense so they doubled down on becoming even more offensive minded, going from 4th in offensive rating last season to the best this season, even if it meant sliding down the  league rankings on defense (from 22nd to 24th).\n\nJust like in other things in life, we often find weaknesses glaring, but it should not make the Pistons blind of the strengths that carried the team to the top of the East at the halfway mark of the season.",
