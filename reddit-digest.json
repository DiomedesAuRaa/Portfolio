        "selftext": "108Any win is scored equal in history. Every Super Bowl-winning team is remembered, but some were more dominant than the others. Simple win-loss record can show dominant teams to some extent, but there were many teams that had an equal record, and won their playoff games. Example: 1979 Steelers, 1983 Raiders, 1993 Cowboys, 1995 Cowboys, 2002 Bucs, 2008 Steelers, 2014 Patriots, 2015 Broncos, 2019 Chiefs all went 12-4 and then won their playoff games. Were they all equal in strength?\n\nWinning some game by a large margin (see Seahawks-Broncos Super Bowl) is more impressive than winning on a FG attempt in the last seconds that can be good or go wide (see Giants-Bills or Vinatieri's kicks). Therefore, the margin of victory, points scored-points allowed, generally shows more dominant teams.\n\nHowever, it is much easier to beat 2025 Jets by 20 points than to beat 2025 Patriots by the same 20 points. Also, it is much more impressive to hold a strong 2025 Rams offense to 21 points scored than to hold weak 2025 Browns to the same 21 points. It is much more difficult to score 22 points against 2025 Seahawks than 22 points against 2025 Cowboys. Schedule matters a lot. Simple Rating System measures margin of victory for each team and adjusts for the schedule that season. DVOA is even finer than SRS, it measures team quality on play-by-play basis, not just points, and adjusts for the strength of opponent's pass defense, run defense, pass offense, run offense.\n\nHere is a table of Super Bowl winners ranked to each other by their win-loss % (regular season+playoffs), by their average margin of victory (regular season+playoffs) and by their DVOA (regular season+playoffs games). Teams are ranked by the average of these 3 rankings. If someone prefers only wins or only points or only DVOA, you can look at that column. Ranking 1-60 is in parentheses. Some teams have played 20 games, some only 14, so win-loss is given as a percentage in order to compare them. SRS of only the regular season is given as an info, it is similar to DVOA.\n\n|Super Bowl -winning team|win-loss % (rank 1-60)|average margin of victory (rank 1-60)|SRS (only regular season)|DVOA (rank 1-60)|average rank of win %, MOV, DVOA rankings|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1985 Bears|94.7% (#2)|17.8 (#1)|15.9|52.3% (#2)|1.67|1|\n|1991 Redskins|89.5% (#6)|16.9 (#2)|16.6|53.9% (#1)|3|2|\n|1989 49ers|89.5% (#6)|15.2 (#6)|10.7|45.1% (#4)|5.33|3|\n|1984 49ers|94.7% (#2)|16.0 (#4)|12.7|39.5% (#12)|6|4|\n|1973 Dolphins|88.2% (#14)|14.4 (#7)|13.3|42.6% (#7)|9.33|5|\n|1998 Broncos|89.5% (#6)|13.4 (#11)|8.9|40.0% (#11)|9.33|6|\n|1996 Packers|84.2% (#22)|15.7 (#5)|15.3|44.9% (#5)|10.67|7|\n|1975 Steelers|88.2% (#14)|14.1 (#9)|14.2|41.4% (#9)|10.67|8|\n|1972 Dolphins|100% (#1)|13.6 (#10)|11.0|31.7% (#25)|12|9|\n|2004 Patriots|89.5% (#6)|11.1 (#26)|12.8|41.7% (#8)|13.33|10|\n|2025 Seahawks|85% (#20)|12.3 (#18)|12.8|46.4% (#3)|13.67|11|\n|1999 Rams|84.2% (#22)|16.2 (#3)|11.9|35.9% (#16)|13.67|12|\n|1992 Cowboys|84.2% (#22)|12.4 (#15)|10.0|42.8% (#6)|14.33|13|\n|1966 Packers|87.5% (#17)|12.75 (#13)|13.5|39.4% (#14)|14.67|14|\n|1994 49ers|84.2% (#22)|14.3 (#8)|11.6|34.5% (#18)|16|15|\n|2013 Seahawks|84.2% (#22)|12.4 (#15)|13.0|39.5% (#12)|16.33|16|\n|1978 Steelers|89.5% (#6)|11.4 (#22)|8.2|33.3% (#21)|16.33|17|\n|1986 Giants|89.5% (#6)|11.4 (#22)|9.0|30.7% (#28)|18.67|18|\n|2016 Patriots|89.5% (#6)|12.3 (#17)|9.3|27.8% (#38)|20.33|19|\n|1977 Cowboys|88.2% (#14)|11.6 (#20)|7.8|30.4% (#30)|21.33|20|\n|1971 Cowboys|82.4% (#31)|13.2 (#12)|9.9|32.3%(#23)|22|21|\n|2002 Buccaneers|78.9% (#38)|11.5 (#21)|8.8|38.3% (#15)|24.67|22|\n|2009 Saints|84.2% (#22)|11.4 (#22)|10.8|29.5% (#33)|25.67|23|\n|1997 Broncos|80% (#34)|11.2 (#25)|10.7|33.8% (#19)|26|24|\n|1995 Cowboys|78.9% (#38)|9.7 (#34)|9.7|41.4% (#9)|27|25|\n|1976 Raiders|94.1% (#4)|8.9 (#41)|8.5|28.4% (#36)|27|26|\n|1979 Steelers|78.9% (#38)|10.5 (#30)|11.9|35.1% (#17)|28.33|27|\n|2024 Eagles|85.7% (#18)|10.9 (#27)|7.7|27.2% (#40)|28.33|28|\n|2000 Ravens|80% (#34)|12.0 (#19)|8.0|29.4% (#34)|29|29|\n|1969 Chiefs|82.4% (#31)|12.6 (#14)|11.9|26.7% (#42)|29|30|\n|1982 Redskins|92.3% (#5)|9.5 (#36)|7.4|23.7% (46)|29|31|\n|2019 Chiefs|78.9% (#38)|9.7 (#32)|9.1|33.8% (#19)|29.67|32|\n|2017 Eagles|84.2% (#22)|10.8 (#28)|9.4|27.1% (#41)|30.33|33|\n|1990Giants|84.2% (#22)|8.2 (#43)|7.7|30.2% (#31)|32|34|\n|1993 Cowboys|78.9% (#38)|9.7 (#32)|9.6|31.6% (#27)|32.33|35|\n|2022 Chiefs|85 % (#20)|7.0 (#47)|6.2|30.1% (#32)|33|36|\n|1983 Raiders|78.9% (#38)|9.3 (#38)|6.8|32.0% (#24)|33.33|37|\n|2003 Patriots|89.5% (#6)|6.6 (#51)|6.9|22.5% (#48)|35|38|\n|2014 Patriots|78.9% (#38)|10.6 (#29)|10.9|24.8% (#43)|36.67|39|\n|2020 Buccaneers|75% (#49)|9.1 (#40)|9.4|32.4% (#22)|37|40|\n|2005 Steelers|75% (#49)|8.8 (#42)|7.8|31.7% (#25)|38.67|41|\n|1967 Packers|73.5% (#54)|9.8 (#31)|9.4|28.4% (#36)|40.33|42|\n|2008 Steelers|78.9% (#38)|7.8 (#44)|9.8|27.4% (#39)|40.33|43|\n|1974 Steelers|79.4% (#37)|9.1 (#39)|6.8|24.3% (#45)|40.33|44|\n|1968 Jets|81.2% (#33)|9.5 (#37)|7.9|14.6% (#54)|41.33|45|\n|1981 49ers|84.2% (#22)|6.7 (#50)|6.2|14.1% (#55)|42.33|46|\n|1970 Colts|85.3% (#19)|6.9 (#48)|0.4|6.8% (#60)|42.33|47|\n|1988 49ers|68.4% (#59)|6.8 (#49)|4.8|30.7% (#28)|45.33|48|\n|2021 Rams|76.2% (#48)|5.7 (#53)|5.3|28.9% (#35)|45.33|49|\n|2006 Colts|80% (#34)|5.35 (#54)|5.9|22.1% (#49)|45.67|50|\n|2010 Packers|70% (#56)|9.65 (#35)|10.9|23.5% (#47)|46|51|\n|2015 Broncos|78.9% (#38)|4.3 (#58)|5.8|20.0% (#50)|48.67|52|\n|2018 Patriots|73.7% (#52)|7.4 (#46)|5.2|19.6% (#51)|49.67|53|\n|1987 Redskins|77.8% (#47)|7.6 (#45)|3.8|11.9% (#57)|49.67|54|\n|2023 Chiefs|71.4% (#55)|5.19 (#56)|3.7|24.4% (#44)|51.67|55|\n|1980 Raiders|75% (#49)|5.2 (#55)|4.2|17.1% (#52)|52|56|\n|2001 Patriots|73.7% (#52)|5.9 (#52)|4.3|11.9% (#57)|53.67|57|\n|2012 Ravens|70 % (#56)|4.5 (#57)|2.9|15.5% (#53)|55.33|58|\n|2007 Giants|70 % (#56)|2.1 (#59)|3.3|13.6% (#56)|57|59|\n|2011 Giants|65% (#60)|2.0 (#60)|1.6|10.9% (#59)|59.67|60|\n||||||||\n||||||||\n\nSome notes:\n\n* all games, regular season and playoffs, are counted\n* some teams rested their starters, lost last regular season games, which affected their win-loss ranking a lot\n* 1968 Jets and 1969 Chiefs came from the weak AFL, dominated there; it's difficult to rank them\n* some teams, such as 2015 Broncos, 2003 Patriots were #1 seed after winning many close games, see their MOV\n* 9 teams had an average margin of victory over 14 points (2 TDs/game)!\n* some teams, such as 2000 Ravens, 2024 Eagles had a dominant postseason, weren't that strong in the regular season, see their SRS for regular season\n* teams ranked at the bottom upset stronger teams in the playoffs\n* the top 3 teams were dominant by any metric; 1996 Packers would join them, but had only a 13-3 regular season\n* some teams, such as 1984 49ers, 1999 Rams scored a lot against a weaker schedule, so their points ranking is much higher than their DVOA or SRS\n* opposite are teams such as 2004 Patriots, 2025 Seahawks that didn't have as large blowouts, but had a more difficult schedule\n* 1992 and 1995 Cowboys aren't high on win-loss ranking, but had dominant teams on the play-by-play basis, their DVOA because of the stable, unstoppable run offense\n* this shows how much teams dominated their season, teams can't time-travel to play each other; some team doesn't play the same quality in the following season even if the roster is the same (see 2024 & 2025 Eagles)\n\nAs a bonus here is a short list of **dominant recent teams that lost in the playoffs** and how would their stats rank among these 60 if they won a Super Bowl:\n\n|team|win-loss % (rank 1-60)|average margin of victory (rank 1-60)|SRS (only regular season)|DVOA (rank 1-60)|average rank of win %, MOV, DVOA rankings|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2007 Patriots|94.7% (#2)|17.5 (#2)|20.1|51.0% (#3)|2.33|\n|2010 Patriots|82.4% (#31)|11.6 (#20)|15.4|42.4% (#8)|19.67|\n|2019 Ravens|82.4% (#31)|13.7 (#10)|15.6|33.6% (#21)|20.67|\n|2024 Lions|83.3% (#31)|11.55 (#21)|13.8|32.0% (#24)|25.33|\n|2023 Ravens|73.7% (#52)|11.6 (#21)|13.2|44.4% (#6)|26.33|\n|2023 49ers|70% (#56)|9.8 (#32)|11.8|36.3% (#16)|34.67|\n|2025 Rams|70% (#56)|8.7 (#43)|12.5|36.2% (#16)|38.33|\n\nSo 2007 Patriots were somewhere around 1985 Bears, 1991 Redskins. Which team would win in a matchup we'll never know.\n\nThere were some great teams recently that didn't even reach a Super Bowl.\n\nFor those who think that DVOA is a useless model and that only wins-losses should be looked at:\n\n26 teams that had the best or shared the best win-loss record won the Super Bowl that season and 26 other teams that were #1 in DVOA that season won the Super Bowl. Many teams were #1 by both wins and DVOA. So, many teams that weren't #1 won in the playoffs a string of 3 or 4 games. Super Bowl winners that were #1 by DVOA, but not by win-loss were mostly in 1990s: 1999 Rams, Broncos, 1995 Cowboys, 1992 Cowboys, 1990 Giants, also 1988 49ers, 2004 Patriots. Teams that had the best win-loss, but not DVOA were 2022 Chiefs, 2017 Eagles, 2003 Patriots, 1986 Giants, 1982 Redskins, 1981 49ers, 1976 Raiders.\n\nEPA model is popular and very similar to DVOA, but doesn't adjust for the strength of opponents.\n\nData is from Pro Football Reference and from A. Schatz on ESPN.",

He came in after two or three laps, said it was bloody rubbish, and went off in a huff... He was right.\"",

I don’t really watch hockey, and I don’t even really have a takeaway, it’s just kind of impressive.",

All the issues just come back to nba players not giving a shit which is a cardinal sin for a professional sports league.\n\nFor example, we all love to shit on the in season tournament. I actually like the idea of it! But of course it’s lame because of course the players couldn’t give a shit. The funniest thing the NHL could do is institute a complete copycat of the inseason tournament and watch their players take it very seriously and make it VERY meaningful to fans.\n\nFor most of my life NBA was my favorite league with hockey completely off my radar. That’s crept down to about a 60/40 split in favor of nba now. I really don’t know how the nba can fix a single thing if we coddle the players and pretend that treating them fairly means not expecting the bare minimum of them showing up for their jobs.",
