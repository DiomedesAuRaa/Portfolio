Let's be exceedingly clear: the hitting was not the problem.\n\n\nThe Mets failed because their pitching was *abysmal* in the second half. There was a stretch of like six weeks in which David Peterson was the only starter to make it out of the fifth inning. We traded for all-star closer Ryan Helsley, who promptly became the worst reliever in baseball. Our flamethrower setup man Ryne Stanek was almost as bad. The team had the best offensive month *in team history* in August, yet finished with a *losing record* for the month. That's inconceivable. \n\n\nLack of chemistry among stars surely doesn't help. I'm sure it did make a difference. But someone explain how the left fielder and shortstop not getting along has no appreciable impact on the hitting but somehow absolutely decimates the entire pitching staff. It doesn't make sense.\n\n\nAs is the case with every team, winning solves all the problems, and losing exacerbates them. I don't think the team tanked because they lacked chemistry. I think their horrible performance made everything tense and *brought out* the lack of chemistry. ",

He deserves everything in coaching that comes to him. I love having him on our staff. Jernaro makes our team better every day.”\n\n... “BYU is so blessed to have a man like G. who has been there for nine years,” Daniel said. “He should be there for the next 20.”\n\n... “G is the most valuable (assistant) coach at BYU, and it is not close,” Daniel told the Deseret News last month before graduation. “If you want to make some people angry, put that (comment) in the paper. If you want to talk about value, it is not close. That man is so, so valuable to BYU.\n\n“The way he recruits, the way players look up to him, the way they think about him, is (legitimate),” Daniel continued. “Look at the way they respect his word, the way he cares about them. The way he takes time to have those little conversations with them.”\n\n... “With (Gilford), it isn’t always about football. It is the way he talks to them about school, about what the guys are doing off the field. He invites guys over to his house to eat all the time. He is the most valuable guy in the building, and it ain’t close.”\n\n... “The way he treated me when I came in was tremendous,” Daniel said. “You want to talk about a man with no ego, a man who knows what it takes to build a program and know what it is all about, that’s Jernaro. … I came in as a guy who had just retired from playing. He could have said, ‘Just sit there, don’t say much.’ Not Jernaro. He’s not afraid of this or that, of losing his job.”\n",
