Bonds is the first player in the 30-year history of the licensing program not to sign. Because of this withdrawal, his name and likeness are not usable in any merchandise licensed by the MLBPA. In order to use his name or likeness, a company must deal directly with Bonds. For this reason, he does not appear in some baseball video games, forcing game-makers to create generic athletes as replacements. These generic video games replacements tended to be white and sometimes had different handedness which was done likely to avoid potential player likeness lawsuits from Bonds.”",

        "selftext": "If anybody is bored this winter break, IMSA can cure those blues. IMSA has it's feature 24H race the Rolex 24 at Daytona this coming weekend. Soothe your racing withdrawal with the howl of the Valkyrie's N/A V12 or the earth shattering rumble of the three Cadillac V8's amongst a 60 car strong grid - competing for outright or class victory in 4 classes featuring 3 spec categories and 14 different race cars.\n\nIMSA endurance races are easy to just leave on the TV and relax on your Saturday morning or evening (or Sunday morning for those in Asia and Oceania). You don't have to follow the championship closely as this is the first race, so it's an easy onboarding point as everybody starts from square one. \n\nIt's the IMSA series' most prestigious race, being the race the Rolex Daytona itself is named for, and having happened for over 50 years, with roots tracing back to the 50's. Winners in each class are presented with special edition Rolex Daytona watches - a classy way to show off your feat of endurance and speed after the chequered flag falls.\n\nThe series is topped by the GTP class - also known as Hypercar in WEC. These racing machines can be powered by any choice of gasoline engine, and can be of a standard hybrid configuration with four chassis backbones to choose from amongst other common parts- the LMDh specification. Or, can be fully custom, custom hybrid to the front wheels or non hybrid, any chassis within specifications - the LMH specification. IMSA features the Porsche, BMW, Acura and Cadillac LMDh spec GTP's, and the non-hybrid Aston Martin Valkyrie LMH GTP. The Porsche and BMW GTP's are powered by TT V8's, the Acura GTPs by a TT V6, the three Cadillac GTPs have N/A V8's, and last but certainly not least the lone Aston Martin GTP is powered by a N/A V12.\n\nThe second class is LMP2. This is a very fast prototype as it was originally designed to compete below the old and faster than GTP/Hypercar LMP1 cars of WEC. If they weren't slowed down, they would be as fast as the GTP's. These cars are fun to watch battle on track, and have a distinctive and memorable exhaust note from their tanky Gibson LMP2 V8 engines. The class is uniform in choice of the Oreca 07 LMP2 machine, due to it being the best option available in a very mature 2017 LMP2 formula.\n\nThe final two classes, one fully pro and one with a Bronze amateur or Silver rank driver in each car, are the road based GTD-Pro and GTD classes of GT3 cars. This is a standard racing car based on a road car built by the manufacturer of the car - with 8 models competing in IMSA this year, there are 15 in GTD Pro and 23 in GTD to round us out. There are cars from BMW, Ferrari, Porsche, Chevrolet, Lamborghini, Mercedes, Ford and Lexus in GTD Pro and GTD.\n\nThe multi-class nature of the race adds an extra element to every class. Top class cars have to overtake everybody, LMP2 has to pass the GT's and get passed by GTP, and the GTD classes get passed by everybody - all while battles for position and victory happen within the class the car competes. It can be of benefit to take big risks with traffic and gain a big gap - or alternatively get stuck and potentially have an opponent close up or pass while you're filling up somebody else's mirrors! Traffic management can make or break a race or victory, and mismanagement can result in race-ending crashes. It always adds exciting spice, and that's one of the reasons we love sportscar racing.\n\nTeams of three or four drivers compete in each car. The balance of the car's performance can shift between day heat and night chill, so the order is jumbling around throughout the race. IMSA's trigger happy safety car system, known as Full Course Yellow or FCY, also means that cars are regularly bunched up and if you're a lap down you can overtake and rejoin at the back - a life saver if you face an issue that isn't race ending.\n\nIt's on YouTube for those outside of the US* **for free**. Race is 6:40pm Saturday GMT, click Remind Me and check your local time here on Part 1 of the stream (first 10 hours) - [RACE STREAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGOgs9bE-98)\n\nCheck out these extended highlights of last year's Rolex 24 at Daytona to get an idea of what to expect - [2025 Rolex 24 at Daytona Extended Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0YEh9z-UkQ)\n\nUS TV viewers can watch some with start and finish on NBC and USA Network showing portions of the race saturday afternoon.

I know Brahim well because I selected him for the Spanish national team, and I would like to say that this is sport, nothing more. You have to show that you can win, and that you can lose. We mustn't go overboard. He didn't do anything wrong, he didn't murder anyone.

He did it in a World Cup final, and I remember Sergio Ramos did it in a big match as well. When you score, nobody says anything, everyone applauds, but when you miss, there’s a lot of harsh criticism for a player who is truly outstanding. I know him—I called him up for the Spanish national team for a match. He’s an exceptional player, and this is very unfair*. »\n\n  \n“We talked about it today on the bus.

He is an exceptional player and a very good person. I understand that it is difficult to accept. It was strange, but it's sport, nothing more,” explained Luis Enrique, who tried to play down the issue. \"The most important thing is the values you can convey to people.

Sal quipped something about it at first, Bill pressed on, and Sal just gave no response to each catch’s description as Bill continued to converse with himself. \n\nAdd this on top of Bill’s utter disbelief that anyone would think Stafford’s 46 TD 8 INT season is MVP-worthy, and I think the bias is starting to eat at Sal. \n\nYou can tell he actually wants to call him out more aggressively, but we all have those more childish friends who need to be treated with kid gloves, and Bill is one of them.
