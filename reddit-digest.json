He's obviously tailing off, but you look at those other guys on that list and he still seems years away from being at that level, and those guys were mostly worthy rotation players when they retired. \n\n\nWe'll obviously never know because he'll retire years before he's the 8th guy in a rotation playing 12 MPG, but that really does seem like it would be 5+ years away at this point. ",

I have had the exact same experience with at least 5-10 people where I’ve said *’no I promise you I am 100% sure that Sandy Koufax is still around…’*\n\nI guess it is because even though he left the game so young, he pitched in an era where virtually every one of his peers have passed?

It’s the worst Arsenal team I’ve ever seen in terms of cohesion and I’ve been a fan for 25 years. \n\nPeople will say if he was given more time he may have gotten better, and maybe so.

Taking that into consideration it's easy to think it's not as impressive a feat as the headline first makes out. However to be in your 50s and physically be capable of doing even just cameos when for many people (including ex athletes) at that age just having one charity match can cause injury is very impressive. Plus looking at his overall career while he never emulated his success in Japan when he went overseas, in his prime he was a beast. 118 goals in 197 games between 1992 and 1998.",

Then, you add the *constant* shuffling and C and LG plus the ongoing injury at LT (remember that Decker *barely* practiced this season even when he was playing) and it's undeniable that Goff's protection was significantly worse. \n\n* Goff got a significant downgrade at OC and had to switch playcallers halfway through the year.\n\n* The run game was massively inconsistent. While it helped the offense at times, it completely disappeared in other games.\n\n* Goff basically did not have a tight end to work with all year. After the injuries to SLP and then even Wright, the TE spot was PS guys for the back half of the season. \n\n* St Brown had an uncharacteristic number of drops this year and, for as much as we all love Jamo, he is still among the league leaders in drop rate. \n\nYet despite all of these things, Goff remains:\n\n* Top three in passing yards\n\n* Top three in passer rating\n\n* Top two in TDs\n\n* Top two in TD-INT ratio\n\n* Top five in completion percentage \n\n* Top ten in yards per completion (top 7 if you remove QBs with 8 or fewer starts)\n\nIs he perfect every game? Obviously not. Does his inability to scramble limit him in ways that impact the game? Yes. \n\nBut can you look at these stats *considering the situation around Goff* and say that *he* is the problem? No idea how you get there.",

Not to mention a bunch of the supporting characters (who are there specifically TO be spent as stakes-raising capital). hell, this pic is missing Will, Joyce, Dustin, Steve, Jonathan, Holly, and Nancy, too!\n\nShow just completely disappeared up its own ass starting in Season 3, and lost all control of what it was trying to be. It became a clumsy (and overly precious, on top of that) pastiche of Marvel/Superhero storytelling in cheap 80s drag, and not any kind of King/Spielberg/Carpenter homage anymore.\n\nThe most 80s thing about it is that it got dumber, worse, and more expensive as it kept going, and then went long past the point of it ever hoping to be good again. Like it started as a prestige tribute to Amblin/Universal suburban fantasy - and now it's basically a Golan/Globus - Cannon Films co-production, only with Marvel Money behind it (instead of getting its budget slashed last second.)\n\nThat sucks.",
