Entered the playoffs cold and lost in the Wild Card round.\n\n• **2024 Pittsburgh Steelers**  \nFinished 10-7 but dropped their last four games. Several outlets noted they were only the third team in NFL history to enter the playoffs on a four-game losing streak.\n\n• **1986 New York Jets** (a little different but worth mentioning)  \nThey lost five straight to end the season, still made the playoffs, and actually won their Wild Card game before losing the next round.\n\nSo if the Packers lose this Vikings game and head into the playoffs on a four-game skid, they would be joining a list that is basically two teams long, or three if you include the Jets with the longer streak.",

I’m hearing fans and media say the expectation is the playoff but have you looked at that schedule next year? They could easily have a better team and win less games than this year. The schedule this year was a dream, basically 3 tough games. Next year they’ve got Oklahoma, Indiana, Penn State, @ Oregon, @ Ohio State. Even Iowa and @ Minnesota are tricky. Regardless of where you fall on the coaching hire, seems like expectations need to be tempered.  I think 8-9 wins is where I’d predict and that likely doesn’t get you in. ",

He comes in, spaces the floor, pressures the ball, and doesn’t need the offense run for him to contribute.\n\nWhat really stands out is how natural he looks in the role. He’s decisive, plays under control, and doesn’t hijack possessions. That’s exactly what you want next to Cade or running the second unit.",
