This game has shaped me, but now it’s time to focus on my true purpose on this earth full time. I’ll be finishing my degree at the University of Michigan. Thank you to everyone who has supported me on this journey the best is still ahead.\"\n\nIn early December, Hausmann explained that he departed the program and the country after an unfortunate experience with U-M staff member.\n\n\"This is why I left America,\" wrote Hausmann. \"You tell one staff member about an experience I had with my faith. An experience where I was trying to figure out what was going on, still knowing I was in season. So I thought it would be smart to talk to someone. So I go to the building where I spend most of my calendar year, the football facility. I thought I would receive guidance and clarity, as it was a life-changing experience. After hearing what I had to say, I got put in the category of a mental patient who is going to end their life. If anyone has a clue who I was, they know that’s the last thing I would ever do.\"\n\n#GoBlue",

These teams become so bad and helpless and fans don't even care.\n\nNBA NEEDS TO STEP UP!",

It was released in 2005 and has a star-studded cast (Crowe, Zelwegger, and Giamatti) and is a greater-than-sports ultimate underdog story. It is also a period piece and is directed by Ron Howard. And it's a boxing movie!\n\nIt also won awards. \n\nAnd - by the way - is a great effing movie.\n\nI'm going to assume that they made a mistake and forgot about it, otherwise, I got real beef with this list.  \n",

But the things he is a positive overlap with what Luka already does. \n\n\nMoreover, he a net negative defensively and putting that much money into two bad defensive players seems like a bad idea.\n\ni think trading for Anthony Davis solves their problems. Now that Nico is fired, the Mavs are reportedly shopping him as they are now rebuilding. The lakers also have the institutional knowledge to keep AD healthy. Mavs should do this to get rid of the AD contract with LeBrons expiring.\n\nAD should be a better fit with Luke and help shore up their defense and be a decent lob target. There is also the hilarity of the both the trade and LeBron reuninitig with Kyrie.\n\n",
