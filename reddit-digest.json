I was 1000% into mlb at that age, & I learned so much about the history of baseball & it's greatest players & stadiums through playing this game & looking info up in encyclopedias that I would pick up through playing. It let you simulate seasons & I think I got my love of tracking / learning statistics through this game, I had a binder where I would manually keep track of all kinds of stats & standings as I played. I created custom players using baseball card stats or newspaper stats & I sunk countless hours into this game. \n        \nI know I continued playing it for a few years & enjoyed it so much & I think it helped make me into the sports fan I am today.

        "selftext": "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR7pjMr9EWQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR7pjMr9EWQ)\n\n**Interviewer:** Are you currently watching any series? Do you have a recommendation for a series or movie?\n\n**Manuel Neuer :** No, and I don't have a recommendation, and the reason is that we're trying not to turn on the TV when the child is around. We're trying as much as possible to keep the phone and tablet away.\n\nOf course, you sometimes need the phone. He sometimes grabs it and walks around saying \"hello,\" because he sees how I talk on the phone, so he holds something in his hand and says \"hello, hello.\" That's cute, but we're trying as much as possible to stay away from that.\n\n**Interviewer:** Your assessment for 2025?\n\n**Neuer:** I think the Club World Cup brought us closer together and had a positive impact on us. It's true that we unfortunately went out against Paris Saint-Germain, but I believe it was an even matchup. Maybe everyone expected them to beat Chelsea in the final, but that didn't happen. We put in good performances\n\nFor example, in the Champions League against Paris Saint-Germain, and then we also beat Chelsea. We're in a very good position. Before the winter break, we're in an excellent spot in all the competitions. We've got huge momentum.\n\nI think the summer was beneficial for us, as we were able to reintegrate one or two players into the team. And I simply believe we have a very strong squad. Plus, three players are now returning after long absences: Ito, Davies, Musiala. And it feels like new additions for the season, because they've been out for such a long time.\n\n**Interviewer:** Speaking of summer talk about the small size of the squad?\n\n**Neuer:** It always remains a topic of discussion within the team. It's natural to think about it and exchange opinions, but when players like Thomas Müller are absent, in that moment you wonder: Well, what will happen now? Will another player come in? This is important for us as a team, and we really do think about it. But in general, it can be said that the situation at Bayern Munich has always been like this in the past: we have to trust the management, and we've been able to do that.\n\nFor us, the most important thing is to always be at least on an equal footing internationally with the other clubs. And as we see now in the Champions League table, we are at least among the top eight teams.\n\n**Interviewer:** How do transfer rumors get handled in the dressing room?\n\n**Neuer:** It depends a lot on the intensity of the talk. A topic doesn’t come up just because of a short tweet, for example. But when everyone starts talking about it, that’s when it actually reaches the team. We can’t always get caught up in these side matters, because we have work to do.\n\nOur focus is always on the next match, and on what’s happening right now. Then there are potential transfers that may or may not happen. Like what happened in the summer with Volpato, where the topic was widely discussed, and so it became a conversation within the team as well.\n\n**Interviewer:** There are many who say about you that you're the best goalkeeper in football history. How do you deal with that?\n\n**Neuer:** With complete calm.\n\n**Interviewer:** You say that so simply?\n\n**Neuer:** Yes, that's how I handle it when someone tells me that. I'm very comfortable in this regard, and I know that what's important is here and now. And what matters to us as a team is what will come in the upcoming matches.\n\nWhen you help the team, and deliver your level on the pitch, and try to be there for your defense, that's always the most important thing. That's how success comes, and collective success is always much more important than individual or personal success. And that's fundamentally the first thing that's instilled in the professional player.\n\n**Interviewer:** About your move to Bayern?\n\nNeuer: At that time, there were a large number of national team players; I had played with them previously in the national team, and even in the 2010 World Cup. Everyone stood by my side and supported me, and they all tried, if I may put it that way, to make the transfer process smooth and focused. All the Bayern players wanted that. And we would say: We can build something together. Not just to win the league and the cup, but also to become champions of Europe.\n\n**Interviewer:** Who was the biggest “agent” for you on your way to Bayern Munich?\n\nNeuer: Bastian Schweinsteiger, without a doubt. And also Philipp Lahm. Then Thomas Müller as well.\n\n**Interviewer:** Did they at least get a commission?\n\nNeuer: No. In fact, no. They earned that themselves through the successes.\n\n**Interviewer:** What are you playing?\n\nNeuer: We were playing cards. But with Bayern's transfer policy, it's no longer possible to sign players who are good at it, because many of those who used to play it, like Philipp Lahm, Andreas Ottl, and even Claudio Pizarro, are no longer around. Now only a few members of the staff play it, like the physiotherapists. Currently we're playing Mario Kart.\n\n**Interviewer:** Which character do you choose?\n\nNeuer: Yoshi. But everyone chooses Yoshi. Everyone has the same car, just with different colors.\n\n**Interviewer:** Are you good?\n\nNeuer: I'm the worst. Because I didn't play much as a kid, and that's the problem.\n\n**Interviewer:** Do you have a fixed seat on the plane or on the bus?\n\nNeuer : Yes, I have a fixed spot. On the plane, I sit at the emergency exit because the legroom there is bigger. And on the bus, I sit at a four-person table.\n\n**Interviewer:** With whom?\n\nNeuer: To my right is Leon Goretzka, and diagonally in front of me is Koni Laimer, and the seat across is empty, because Thomas always sat there...\n\n**Interviewer:** About your relationship with Goretzka\n\nNeuer: Leon Goretzka was always sending me meme videos and such on Instagram, one after the other. And at some point I said to him: Stop with this nonsense. He always knew that I don't laugh at these things. I didn't find what he was sending me all that great, but he couldn't stop, because he enjoyed them so much and found them extremely amusing.",
