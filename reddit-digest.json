Whittingham has always done much more with less, this move could be the exciting change that he needed to bring out the best in him. As someone who has never cared one way or the other about Michigan football, I will be a new fan rooting for all the success coach Whitt deserves, hope to see him get his natty that he deserved in 08 btw lol. Perfect hire at the perfect time, the football program can finally, hopefully, be scandal free for now at least. Very unfortunate how this new age of college football is affecting coaching so violently, but it is what it is. Good luck this coming season Go Blue and Go Utes!",

        "selftext": "I had been looking through a number of different things trying to find if there is something that ties a good number of our issues together, and there is. I was looking through our draft picks over the last couple of seasons and happened to scroll back down to some of Bob Quinn's picks and I realized that he is the reason we have absolutely no veteran depth at any positions.\n\nlions players still on the team from 2015-2020 (I know Quinn was hired in 2016 but he was in charge of retaining the 2015 crew)\n\n* Taylor Decker \n* Graham Glasgow\\*\n* Pat O'Connor\\*\n\nThat's it, and while you may think that's not horrible for draft classes from 5+ years ago in the small amount of digging I've done on average it seems teams have retained around 10 players on average. This is what i believe to be the largest contribution to not only why injuries to certain positions cause such a big drop off in play but also why we've had so many injuries, as almost every other team has veteran players they've been able to keep around and use to take the load off or fill in for starters.\n\nNow what this information actually means is that we need to give brad and dan time to keep acquiring players with the right mindset that want to be here for a long time, so in three years one injury doesn't tank the entire season and when we catch an injury bug like this we've got some home grown guys who've been with us the whole time to lean back on. This is the reason I think he traded up for TeSlaa someone who may never be no.1 caliber, but is someone who obviously wants to spend their whole career here. This is also the reason I don't think we are at a position where we can take the F-them picks approach just yet to go get someone like Maxx Crosby or Myles Garrett, because if an injury at another position means we have to field a player that nullifies whoever we acquire there is no point in going and getting them.",

When people say \"every team deals with injuries, look at the 49ers\" the 9ers have had 8 years of drafts and free agencies under john Lynch and co, and have been able to consistently draft and sign players that for within their system. They also dont have injuries compounding like we do. Ya Fred Warner got hurt, but the guy behind him stayed healthy. Unlike last year where alim got hurt, then his back up got hurt, and on and on. Brad has had 4 drafts, which is around 28 players. And hes hit on close to 40% which is pretty damn good, but we need a 55 man roster. Now his free agency needs some work but thats the biggest issue is that we dont have that depth with players who are familiar with the system to come in right away and fill a hole\n\nAlso, \"the 49ers traded away deebo, they traded for cmc and Trent williams- lions are too beholden to their own guys\" yep, deebo was an aging receiver with injury history making way to much money against the cap, whereas the lions players are all before or in their prime years. Trent Williams was able to be procured for a song, and CMC was the final piece for them to be able to consistently compete for a superbowl. But dont look at their record pre or post 2019, or even last year cuz that doesnt fit the narrative we want about the lions' window being closed",
