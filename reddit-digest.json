Sal quipped something about it at first, Bill pressed on, and Sal just gave no response to each catch’s description as Bill continued to converse with himself. \n\nAdd this on top of Bill’s utter disbelief that anyone would think Stafford’s 46 TD 8 INT season is MVP-worthy, and I think the bias is starting to eat at Sal. \n\nYou can tell he actually wants to call him out more aggressively, but we all have those more childish friends who need to be treated with kid gloves, and Bill is one of them.
