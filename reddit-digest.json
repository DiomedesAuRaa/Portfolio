        "selftext": "1894 Yale was the only other college football team besides Indiana to go 16-0, so obviously the were the best team during that entire time period. So let’s say after next season, (Once the 2026 regular season is over) a scientist found a way to bring people back to life and brought the entire 1894 Yale team back. The scientist was able to make them exactly how they were during that 1894 season, (same athleticism and age) and the University of Yale football program decided to get rid of all their current players and add that 1894 team to their new roster.\n\nNow, during the 2026-2027 offseason, that entire Yale team had all that time to be taught the way football works in the modern world, train and weight lift, learn Yale’s current playbook, anything they need to learn to be able to compete for the 2027 season.\n\nThe NCAA then decided to add them into the FBS, as well as ban them from getting any transfers or add any new high school recruits to their roster. They then get added as an independent. The NCAA also allows them to have unlimited practice, and let’s say this is all in a scenario that this 1894 Yale team is fully committed and motivated to playing football again, as well as it is impossible for the players to get injured and the refs have a bias towards them in every game. They also have the easiest schedule out of any FBS team in 2027.\n\nNow this begs the question, how would they perform in the 2027 season? Would they just get belt to ass every single game? Maybe sneak in a win or two?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1r4sz5j/who_else_could_join_north_dakota_state_in_the_fbs/",
        "selftext": "# -------\n\nNorth Dakota State is poised to become the 137th member of the FBS level, starting in the mountain west conference this upcoming season. [^(1)](https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/47870245/sources-north-dakota-state-joins-mountain-west-football) So, who else *could* theoretically join them?  Key word here is *could*, not necessarily will. I used 6 factors in finding the potential teams. You can find them below with some explainers. The schools that meet the minimum criteria are scored > 1. A score of 1.0 means a school meets the minimum FBS requirements. The factors were then very crudely weighted until I got a result I liked\n\n## Factors:\n\n**Enrollment** – this is an obvious one, how many students (and alumni) does a school have to support it. The current lowest enrollment in the FBS is Tulsa, with \\~4000 students.[^(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tulsa)\n\n**Endowment** – this is a bit less obvious. The correlation coefficient for a university’s Endowment and Athletics budget is only 0.27, but this is limited due to the amount of private universities in the FCS, which don’t often share athletics budget information. There is some noise there, and endowment is reflective a schools resource. It will not be weighted heavily. The FBS schools with the lowest endowment is Coastal Carolina[^(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_Carolina_University) with an endowment of \\~$77MM.\n\n**Athletics Revenue** – Probably the most important factor here. Due to the many private FCS schools, I had to give a revenue of $0 if I could not find it, so the results are definitely skewed. I was able to find Harvard’s[^(4)](https://gocrimson.com/documents/2024/10/30/Final_2024_EADA_Survey.pdf) and Villanova’s[^(5)](https://www1.villanova.edu/content/dam/villanova/finance/documents/financialstatements/FinancialStatements24.pdf) after some less than intensive searching. Much of the information came from Knight-Newhouse[^(6)](https://knightnewhousedata.org/fbs)^(.) The FBS school with the lowest revenue is Louisiana-Monroe with \\~$19MM.[^(6)](https://knightnewhousedata.org/fbs)\n\n**Stadium Capacity** – the NCAA used to require FBS schools to average 15K fans to meet eligibility, but as of 2023[^(7)](https://www.texasfootball.com/article/2023/10/31/the-ncaa-announced-new-fbs-requirements-here-are-the-biggest-hurdles-for-fcs-programs#:~:text=Share%20or%20Save%20for%20Later,schools%20wishing%20to%20move%20up.) no longer requires this. I will keep it here as I think it's a fine criteria to have (and it makes the math easier).\n\n**Recent Success** \\- how many times a team has made the FCS Playoff in the past 10 years\n\n## The list:\n\n**Rank**\t|**Team**\t|**Endowment**\t|**Enrollment**\t|**AD Revenue**\t|**Stadium Capacity**\t|**Recent Success**\t|**Score**\n\n**|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|**\n\n| |\\*MEDIAN FCS\\*\t|$173400881.5\t|9258.5\t|$15296024.5\t|11250\t|1\t|1.035\n\n1\t|Harvard\t|$50700000000\t|21613\t|$43636552\t|30323\t|1\t|15.595\n\n2\t|Yale\t|$41400000000\t|12093\t|$0\t|61446\t|1\t|12.53\n\n3\t|Princeton\t|$35800000000\t|8478\t|$0\t|27800\t|0\t|10.135\n\n4\t|Penn\t|$21000000000\t|23374\t|$0\t|52593\t|0\t|7.105\n\n5\t|Columbia\t|$14800000000\t|36649\t|$0\t|17000\t|0\t|5.16\n\n6\t|Cornell\t|$10700000000\t|26284\t|$0\t|21500\t|0\t|3.895\n\n7\t|UC Davis\t|$2000000000\t|40848\t|$50059304\t|10849\t|4\t|3.69\n\n8\t|*Delaware*\t|$1780000000\t|24221\t|$58133283\t|18500\t|4\t|3.52\n\n9\t|Villanova\t|$1310000000\t|9900\t|$65090000\t|12500\t|6\t|3.465\n\n10\t|*North Dakota State*\t|$457000000\t|11592\t|$29948436\t|19000\t|10\t|3.435\n\n11\t|South Dakota State\t|$213000000\t|11465\t|$29836789\t|19340\t|10\t|3.37\n\n12\t|Montana\t|$241600000\t|10811\t|$28970312\t|25200\t|8\t|3.05\n\n13\t|Sacramento State\t|$92991000\t|31451\t|$43065314\t|21195\t|4\t|2.985\n\n14\t|Montana State\t|$264000000\t|17144\t|$28397789\t|20767\t|7\t|2.925\n\n15\t|Weber State\t|$219555666\t|29914\t|$18433998\t|17000\t|6\t|2.76\n\n16\t|North Dakota\t|$422100000\t|15019\t|$36995926\t|12283\t|6\t|2.745\n\n17\t|New Hampshire\t|$475100000\t|14784\t|$33102605\t|11015\t|6\t|2.64\n\n18\t|Illinois State\t|$224700000\t|21546\t|$31460587\t|13391\t|5\t|2.56\n\n19\t|Brown\t|$7200000000\t|10737\t|$0\t|20000\t|0\t|2.545\n\n20\t|Dartmouth\t|$7900000000\t|6746\t|$0\t|15000\t|0\t|2.53\n\n21\t|Stony Brook\t|$390500000\t|25710\t|$40920954\t|12300\t|2\t|2.3\n\n22\t|Tennessee State\t|$91100000\t|8198\t|$20209138\t|68798\t|1\t|2.165\n\n23\t|*Missouri State*\t|$193000000\t|23418\t|$34252090\t|17500\t|2\t|2.14\n\n24\t|South Dakota\t|$328500000\t|9971\t|$25893184\t|10000\t|5\t|2.1\n\n25\t|Richmond\t|$3200000000\t|3914\t|$0\t|8400\t|5\t|2.1\n\n26\t|Northern Arizona\t|$198200000\t|28194\t|$28121139\t|15300\t|2\t|2.09\n\n27\t|William & Mary\t|$1500000000\t|9517\t|$36410837\t|12259\t|2\t|2.07\n\n28\t|Northern Iowa\t|$163000000\t|9021\t|$22170455\t|16000\t|5\t|2.065\n\n29\t|Cal Poly\t|$285300000\t|22000\t|$43594326\t|11075\t|1\t|2.01\n\n30\t|Lehigh\t|$2200000000\t|7692\t|$0\t|16000\t|4\t|1.875\n\n31\t|Idaho\t|$465000000\t|11849\t|$24035157\t|16000\t|3\t|1.855\n\n32\t|Tarleton\t|$42000000\t|14092\t|$28200122\t|24000\t|2\t|1.845\n\n33\t|Rhode Island\t|$203000000\t|18061\t|$37478061\t|5180\t|2\t|1.845\n\n34\t|Southern Illinois\t|$171801763\t|18107\t|$19924295\t|15276\t|3\t|1.84\n\n35\t|Youngstown State\t|$321500000\t|11076\t|$21696473\t|20650\t|3\t|1.835\n\n36\t|Chattanooga\t|$147100000\t|11775\t|$22565863\t|20668\t|3\t|1.825\n\n37\t|Lamar\t|$161000000\t|17850\t|$23835722\t|16000\t|2\t|1.73\n\n38\t|Eastern Kentucky\t|$78800000\t|14324\t|$25201250\t|20000\t|2\t|1.72\n\n39\t|Towson\t|$87800000\t|22294\t|$30232859\t|11000\t|1\t|1.675\n\n40\t|Stephen F.

This is corporate greed ruining what was once a marquee event, plain and simple.\n\nI recorded this from my $450 upper level seat (which I feel like an absolute sucker for buying). Lower level seats through the Clippers were going for $2K.\n\nMost of the people I saw there had media credentials or team laminates on. Very few “fans.” LA loves basketball…there should have been people hanging from the rafters for this.\n\nBallmer should be ashamed, the Clippers should be ashamed, the NBA should be ashamed.\n\nGive some tickets to an Inglewood school at least!
