Feeling on top of the world, they disrespected us by blasting highlights from the Lions’ NFC Championship loss to the Niners on the jumbotron.\n\nEver since then, I’ve been running permanent hate circles around that shit franchise. The Kings are a joke, always have been, always will be. Hope they’re enjoying whatever the hell the Westbrook–DeRozan era is supposed to be, because that’s as good as they deserve",
