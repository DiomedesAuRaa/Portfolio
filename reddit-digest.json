        "selftext": "ive seen a lot of comments about Kyles departure from Utah. I understand that it was messy, i understand theres some layers here, and i understand that people are not necessarily paying close attention to whats going on at Utah on that level. I would be surprised if you were.\n\nJust wanted to lay it out for anyone that cares.\n\nas Kyle Whittingham aged, he started to say that he didnt have an interest in coaching beyond 65. He didnt want to be a lifer. This lead to Morgan Scalley being named the head coach in waiting in 2019. Kyle had received HC offers for a long time, and at that point, Morgan started to receive significant offers as well. Utahs 2019 defense was one of the best in the country, and half of them have been long time NFL starters, on top of the others who were drafted.\n\na few years later, Morgans HC in waiting title was stripped, but Kyle was the one pounding the table for it to be reinstated, as he felt he was the one to lead the program for the foreseeable future.\n\nFlash forward to 2024. It was widely accepted to be Kyles last year, including by Kyle himself. Cam Rising goes down (again :( ...) and Utah gets gutted by injuries beyond finishing the year with qb5 on the way to a 5-7 record. Kyle walks off the field in game 12 with his wife and tears in his eyes. Its his last game.\n\nweeks go on, and the competitive motherfucker that Kyle is, decides he cant go out like that. Morgan is understandably upset, as everything he was told until then was that its his go in 2025. When the dust settles, he decides to stay on and let Kyle go for a last dance and end on a good note\n\nUtah has a pretty damn good team in 2025, and ends up a few plays short of their goals. Something changes with Kyle here. I think Kyle being that close to having his go in the playoff, something hes wanted since Utah was denied the shot to play for it all in 2008, lights that competitive fire in him again. He decides hes not done.\n\nHe decides again that he wants to come back. But, as evidence by his 5 year deal. Hes not really close to done yet. Morgan had been getting significant interest across the country, he understandably is not willing to stay around for however long Kyle decides he wants to go, especially if its multiple years for an undetermined amount of time.\n\nand heres where it lands. If Kyle comes back, Morgan is gone. Utah decision makers leaned toward the future of the program that was anointed in Morgan Scalley. I dont believe Kyle was told he could not return, but admin told him they didnt want to lose Scalley and the future of the program. I do understand if people without my bias can read this as he was forced out. Im sure Kyle felt some type of way that the AD put his support behind the other horse.\n\nMost Utah fans have strong belief in Morgan as the future, but also love Kyle and will support him to the end. Like i said, its messy. You understand why Morgan wouldnt be willing to wait forever. Do you potentially mortgage the future for the next 5 years? I personally believe Kyle earned the right to do whatever he wanted. It wasnt handled perfectly on many levels.\n\nWhat i do know for sure, if you are saying this was because of private equity in any way, you're......lacking information. To put it nicely.\n\nfor the 12 people that have read this far, im open to questions or discussion below\n\nedit: i forgot that im posting about Michigans new HC and this post might actually become visible. Thats on me.",

If Michigan needs a coach in 4 years due to Kyle retiring without a  head coach in waiting we can pull from a large group of options. If utah doesn’t take their coach in waiting they are going to have significantly less options. ",

        "selftext": "The 7-8-1 Cowboys travel to New York (New Jersey, whatever) to play the 2-13 Giants. They will be obvious favorites coming into the game and will probably win, ending their season at 8-8-1. Being a .500 team during the 17-game era is impressive, but Dallas wouldn’t be the only team to accomplish this feat. Out of the 160 combined team seasons (32 teams \\* 5 years) in the 17-game era, only one team has done this…the [2022 Washington Commanders](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/was/2022.htm?__hstc=213859787.25287edd6fe7f70cc880c0c55da6e55e.1757823419524.1766596011900.1766755846656.33&__hssc=213859787.4.1766755846656&__hsfp=2637335241) who went 8-8-1.\n\nSo yeah…it’s hard to be .500 when the schedule is an odd number of games, and Dallas can be in the 1.2% of teams to ever do this, and that’s pretty cool. But the **PERFECT SEASON** is in play here.\n\n**A perfect season is a .500 winning percentage and a point differential of exactly zero**. (Sorry, Bob Griese, Larry Csonka, and Jim Kiick)\n\n**With a 23-point win over the Giants, Dallas would be one of only two teams in history with a perfect season.**\n\nOut of 2,416 team seasons in NFL/AFL history, only one…ONE team in history has ended at .500 with a 0-point differential, a perfect season. **This feat was accomplished by the** [**1984 Bengals**](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cin/1984.htm?__hstc=213859787.25287edd6fe7f70cc880c0c55da6e55e.1757823419524.1766596011900.1766755846656.33&__hssc=213859787.20.1766755846656&__hsfp=2637335241) coached by Sam Wyche and led by a trio of quarterbacks, Ken Anderson, Turk Schonert, and Boomer Esiason, all with at least three starts.  \n\nAs hard as a perfect season has been in the past, it is orders of magnitude harder today given the 17-game schedule. It requires a tie, which has happened only 0.3% of the time since 2021 in the 17-game schedule era (four ties out of 1,360 games). And of course, the tie must be for an 8-8 team, so the odds dwindle quickly.\n\nAs shitty as the Giants are this year and approaching the potential number one pick in the draft, a big win by Dallas in week eighteen is a reasonable expectation. A 23-point win has happened [216 times in NFL history](https://www.sports-reference.com/stathead/tiny/AE4tF). More recently we have had two this season, five last year, and 8 in 2023. The Giants have yet to lose a game by 23 or more this year (lost by 18 twice), and Dallas has yet to win by 23+ (won by 22), but the final week can bring about some freaky results with resting players, guys mentally checked out, and tanking being in play.  It is also possible that some Cowboys come across this post, realize what's at stake, and *try* for *exactly* \\+23 (Dak, CeeDee…we know your one of us, give us the usernames!)\n\nIf Dallas can pull this off, here are the most likely scores based on the number of occurrences in history:\n\n* 30-7 (47 occurrences)\n* 23-0 (40 occurrences)\n* 37-14 (34 occurrences)\n\nDallas has a chance to be great; to do the almost impossible; to do something only 0.04% of teams have ever done…a Perfect Season. The most disappointing outcome would be a 22- or 24-point-win. Keep an eye on this game on January 4^(th), and tune in during the fourth quarter, because these moments don’t come around often.\n\nHappy Holidays, Happy New Year",

Apart from likely saving our season it probably would have been a great way to start developing in the league.",

The problems are far beyond the 2025 draft class or even the 2024 draft class. \n\nIf anything, the 2024 draft class has failed because literally none of those players could stay healthy. Then again, dudes in the 23 and 22 draft have been dropping like flies too. \n\nI think the failures here have been with the coaching. These dudes are straight up botching assignments.",
