Still impressive how constantly good and a dynasty they’ve become, won’t be shocked to see them here again next year.\n\nMassive credit to Blaha, the dude was absolutely the best player on the field tonight- able to move, incredible passes, taking advantage of his big WRs with the ball placement? Couldn’t ask for more. And, ya know, casually beating Joe Burrow’s 2019 yardage record… amazing. An absolute banger of a Stagg Bowl, and HUGE congrats to UWRF!!! Welcome to D3 history!!!",

            "body": "The single seater director of the FIA, Nikolas Tombazis, has revealed his predictions for the early stages of the 2026 [Formula 1](https://www.motorsportweek.com/series/single-seater/formula-1/) season, amid the sport’s new regulations cycle.\n\n2026 sees the introduction of the long-awaited new set of [technical regulations](https://www.fia.com/F126) which renders the season scarcely unable to predict, amid a plethora of major changes.\n\nThese include the new 50-50 hybrid power units and aerodynamic revisions for the cars, which will overall be smaller and lighter.\n\nF1’s shift to further electrification has been a major cornerstone in these regulations, which naturally has led to further speculation as to which Original Engine Manufacturer \\[OEM\\] may have been the most successful.\n\n“I would expect the engine to be the main factor initially, the ICE. We obviously have newcomers and new ICE regulations, so we expect some initial differentiation,”\n\n“But we also believe that we’ve also put in place procedures to, let’s say, enable people to gradually catch up. So we believe that it’s a temporary matter in terms of performance differentiations.\n\n“Then we have completely new aerodynamic regulations as well. Naturally, there will be some solutions that are better and some that are worse. There will be some initial convergence, I guess, over the first six months or one year.”\n\n# F1 2026 end expected to be ‘closer’ than 2025 – Tombazis\n\nThe last major regulation change came about in 2014, when the V6 hybrid era was fully introduced, and saw some sizeable gaps in competitiveness across the grid.\n\nThis has led to inevitable concern that a similar eventuality will transpire, but while Tombazis expects there to be some gulfs early on, he believes the season will end potentiall more competitive than the 2025 campaign.\n\n“For 2026, I would not expect to have the grid quite as close as what we had last year,” he said. “But I would expect that the converged grid \\[later on\\] is closer than what it was in 2025.”\n\nIt appears that progress across the grid has been made already, with Pirelli reporting that its second round of simulator testing saw results much closer between all teams compared to the first.\n\nTombazis is therefore somewhat confident but cautious about just how close the grid from top to bottom will be.\n\n“Reasonably, but we cannot be sure because we don’t have detailed data from the teams, so we don’t know how much downforce they have now or how much horsepower they have,” he said.\n\n“Initially, I think there may be some variation, but we are pretty sure that the converged performance should lead to a smaller \\[more compact\\] grid.”\n\nOf course, gaps in speed between teams could, from the perspective of some fans, form a lack of entertainment factor for them, but Tombazis pointed out that this will not be an issue.\n\n“I think what determines the closeness of the grid is not necessarily the gap between the first and the last,” he explained.\n\n“If one or two teams are in a bit of trouble initially, I don’t think that determines how exciting a championship is.\n\n“Usually that’s determined by how close, let’s say, the people in the top half are, so the teams battling for points and wins. And I think there we will have a reasonably close field.”",

Thank you to everyone who has supported me on this journey the best is still ahead.\"\n\nIn early December, Hausmann explained that he departed the program and the country after an unfortunate experience with U-M staff member.\n\n\"This is why I left America,\" wrote Hausmann. \"You tell one staff member about an experience I had with my faith. An experience where I was trying to figure out what was going on, still knowing I was in season. So I thought it would be smart to talk to someone. So I go to the building where I spend most of my calendar year, the football facility. I thought I would receive guidance and clarity, as it was a life-changing experience. After hearing what I had to say, I got put in the category of a mental patient who is going to end their life.

        "selftext": "Hot take, at least for this sub (especially after we lose a single game), but I don’t think the Pistons need to make any moves at all. The fact of the matter is, the deep bench that allows us to plug and play whoever’s skill set is needed at any point in time is what gives us  an advantage over most other teams. (And those teams don’t have Cade)\n\nWhat happens when we got against a team with amazing interior defense like Cleveland? We sub in players like Dannis to bomb them from outside\n\nWhat happens when the other team is a bit older and slow? Ivey speeds past everyone and hits a ton of easy transition lays \n\nWhat about when the starting lineup is off all together ? Sasser gets his own bucket off the dribble \n\nObviously there are more situations where players like BBall Paul and Levert shine (although Levert has been off lately) but remeber Levert is 38% from three this season. \n\nWe are young. Our window is HUGE as long as Cade and Duren are here. Everyone on this team understands their roles and are ready to play any given night and don’t complain to the media when they are a healthy scratch. They understand that some nights aren’t going to be theirs. They play hard defensively no matter what the score is.This is the team others dream of. No reason to mess it up for an offensive player who takes away from the defensive identity of the team and makes others work even harder to compensate their lack of defensive focus. ",
