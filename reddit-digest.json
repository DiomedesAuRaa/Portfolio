It sucks if you're coming from out of town but like I said earlier if you're in a small party it's not that hard finding tickets on gameday and it's significantly cheaper if you don't care where you sit.",

We blame the refs but that wasn't the issue - should have never lost that game but the two turnovers killed us. \n\nMatt choked and that was our BEST team in this century. We had the second best defense in the NFL that year. They were best in the league in rush defense, second in YPG and third in points allowed. \n\nWe added Tate, Prater, drafted Van Noy, Ebron and had prime Calvin and a REALLY GOOD Reggie Bush. The offensive line performance that year was also the third best in pass blocking at thirteenth in run blocking. \n\nWe had a complete, total team. \n\nIf we beat Dallas (which we 1000% should have), we go into Lambeau and win (we split with them and lost the last game of the year there because of just some dumb play by Matt) and honestly the way that NFCCG went down, I think we could have won that also. Hell, if we beat Green Bay in Week 17, we get the bye and beat Dallas at home to go to the NFCCG anyway. \n\nI would give anything for us to have that type of defensive performance by a defense again, especially with this team.
