Entered the playoffs cold and lost in the Wild Card round.\n\n• **2024 Pittsburgh Steelers**  \nFinished 10-7 but dropped their last four games. Several outlets noted they were only the third team in NFL history to enter the playoffs on a four-game losing streak.\n\n• **1986 New York Jets** (a little different but worth mentioning)  \nThey lost five straight to end the season, still made the playoffs, and actually won their Wild Card game before losing the next round.\n\nSo if the Packers lose this Vikings game and head into the playoffs on a four-game skid, they would be joining a list that is basically two teams long, or three if you include the Jets with the longer streak.",

This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.\n\nAlso make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).\n\nAre you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.\n\nRemember to keep it civil and welcoming!

That’s not empty stat padding that’s instant impact, efficient offense, and real two-way juice. He comes in, spaces the floor, pressures the ball, and doesn’t need the offense run for him to contribute.\n\nWhat really stands out is how natural he looks in the role. He’s decisive, plays under control, and doesn’t hijack possessions. That’s exactly what you want next to Cade or running the second unit.",
