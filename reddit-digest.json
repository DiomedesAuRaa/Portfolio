        "author": "IceColdDrPepper_Here",
        "score": 139,
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1py9jds/haters_breakdown_techs_terrible_horrible_no_good/",
        "selftext": "Record-wise, this season was the best Georgia Tech has had since 2014. But this season ended on a very rough stretch. Tech rambled and wrecked their way through a favorable schedule with an 8-0 start, including a win over Clemson when people thought they were still good, and reached as high as #7 in the AP poll. Yet there were shaky games and signs of concern cropping up. Sloppy wins over Wake Forest and Duke were the first alarm flags on a storm brewing in Raleigh that would begin the terrible slide. NC State haded Tech their first loss of the season was the first domino on the road to 1-4. The one win was a 2-point win over a Boston College team that finished 2-10. They had a multi-week stretch in which their defense was among the worst in the country and when they finally got it fixed against Georgia, their offense was completely stifled and held without a touchdown for the first time all season, and just the third time in the Brent Key era (second in the full-time era). It was Georgia's 8th straight win over Tech, tying the record for most consecutive wins in the series, a record Tech held for almost 70 years despite Georgia's Sisyphean quest to take it for themselves.\n\nBut wait, the Georgia game isn't a conference game, so they still went to Charlotte with a chance to win their way into the playoff via the conference champion auto-bid slot, right? Wrong! Tech was among the group of ACC teams with 2 conference losses that somehow ended up behind Duke due to the asinine tie-breakers the ACC has. Instead, they had to sit at home as Duke dookied all over the ACC's playoff hopes (save for the committee jumping Miami in at the buzzer) and their arch-rival get over their Alabama hump in emphatic fashion to lock up their 2nd straight SEC title, 3rd in the last 4 years, second straight top 4 seed in the 12 team playoff and their 4th playoff appearance in the last 5 years. Oh and they had to watch their star offensive coordinator, most of his staff, and their heir-apparent QB\\* jump ship to Florida (\\*Aaron Philo has not committed to Florida at the time of this writing but I mean come on).\n\nBut at least Notre Dame pitched a hissy fit about not getting into the playoff and they got to go to the best bowl game around in the Pop Tarts Bowl instead of the Irish. And even without their OC they were doing good! Tech had an 11-point lead with as much as 11:13 left in the game. But this is an Atlanta-based football team we're talking about here. BYU held Tech scoreless in the second half and managed to take the lead with 2 minutes to go. But Tech had 2 minutes and all 3 timeouts left to try to save the win. They would manage to get all the way to the BYU 18 with 50 seconds and all 3 of those timeouts. Engineers at heart, though, rather than try to methodically cover the final 18 yards they needed, they decided to just power through logic and force the issue with 4 straight passes to the end zone. None worked, and Haynes King's final pass as a Jacket was intercepted in the end zone to give all the Pop Tarts to the Stormin' Mormons. Well all except Slammin' Strawberry who ran from Pop Tart heaven at the last second.\n\nSo it's certainly a disappointing way to end what once looked like a very promising season for the North Avenue Trade School. And now one has to question where they go from here. In the personal opinion of this writer, Brent Key is a great coach who fits in wonderfully at Tech and he has already had more success on the flats than anyone else has in the last 10 years, certainly more than the last guy. They have a good culture down there in Midtown and they can be set up for success. But success is relative, and to be fair to Tech, the expectations are not what they are at other programs. Would I bet on Brent Key's Jackets to win a national championship? No, but I do think he's capable of consistent 8-win seasons, beating Georgia occasionally (admittedly he should have already gotten 1 win), and competing for ACC titles. But only time will tell if the hope of that future can outweigh the sour taste of what could have been that the end of this season has to have left in the mouths of every Tech fan...\n\n...Or is that just their clear whiskey and 3,000 pound barrel of rum and sugar they're pounding down there at Johnny's Hideaway?",

It let you simulate seasons & I think I got my love of tracking / learning statistics through this game, I had a binder where I would manually keep track of all kinds of stats & standings as I played. I created custom players using baseball card stats or newspaper stats & I sunk countless hours into this game. \n        \nI know I continued playing it for a few years & enjoyed it so much & I think it helped make me into the sports fan I am today.
