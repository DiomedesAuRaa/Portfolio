        "selftext": "Recently, the USC Trojan twitter account posted that USC is [“one of 25 schools with a Super Bowl winning quarterback & an astronaut”](https://xcancel.com/USC_Athletics/status/2021372048933581119#m). They posted this as a response to a post by [Adam Spencer](https://xcancel.com/AdamSpencer4/status/2015997911364972872#m), where he listed every other college that has done the same. I’ll go ahead and copy/paste that post, but add to it by listing a specific QB and one astronaut from each school. I’ll just list one QB and astronaut per school, I understand some schools will have multiple, if not many astronauts. As I did this research, I found some potential errors by Adam Spencer. I’ll comment on those later. \n\n- Alabama (Joe Namath/Robert Hines)\n\n- Arizona (Nick Foles/Richard Scobee)\n\n- BYU (Jim McMahon/?)\n\n- Cal (Aaron Rodgers/Rex Walheim)\n\n- Delaware (Joe Flacco/Lodewijk van den Berg)\n\n- Florida State (Brad Johnson/Norman Thagard)\n\n- Fresno State (Trent Dilfer/Steven Nagel)\n\n- Georgia (Matthew Stafford/?)\n\n- Louisiana Tech (Terry Bradshaw/Randy Odle)\n\n- Miami (OH) (Ben Roethlisberger/?)\n\n- Michigan (Tom Brady/David Scott)\n\n- Navy (Roger Staubach/Wendy Lawrence)\n\n- NC State (Russell Wilson/Christina Koch)\n\n- Notre Dame (Joe Montana/Kevin Ford)\n\n- Oklahoma (Jalen Hurts/Fred Haise)\n\n- Purdue (Drew Brees/Neil Armstrong)\n\n- Southern Miss (Brett Favre/Robert Stewart)\n\n- Stanford (John Elway/Eileen Collins)\n\n- Tennessee (Peyton Manning/Scott Kelly)\n\n- Texas Tech (Patrick Mahomes/Rick Husband)\n\n- UCLA (Troy Aikman/Anna Fisher)\n\n- USC (Sam Darnold/Charles Bolden)\n\n- Washington State (Mark Rypien/John Fabian)\n\n- West Virginia (Jeff Hostetler/Jon McBride)\n\n- Wisconsin (Russell Wilson/Laurel Clark)\n\n\nI was unable to confirm astronauts from three schools Adam Spencer listed: BYU, Georgia, and Miami of Ohio.\n\nBYU is the alma mater of former NASA engineer turned famous YouTuber, Mark Rober. It is also the alma mater of significant planetary scientist and current faculty member, Jani Radebaugh. I could not confirm an astronaut from BYU however. \n\nWhile there were many astronauts from Georgia Tech, I could not confirm an astronaut from the University of Georgia. While doing my research I found [this Facebook post from 2023](https://www.facebook.com/groups/spacehipsters/posts/7144727798905375/), claiming that 14 astronauts came from GT, and zero came from UGA. Georgia is the Alma Mater of journalist John Holliman, who was known for his coverage of space exploration. He might have technically flown in space during his life, but I cannot confirm this. Regardless, he was not an astronaut. \n\nAnd last, while Miami of Ohio [gives out astronaut scholarships](https://miamioh.edu/news/2025/05/two-miami-seniors-earn-2025-astronaut-scholarships.html), there does not seem to currently be anyone from Miami of Ohio who became an astronaut. \n\nSo with all that I can confirm, despite Mark Spencer’s claim, 22 colleges produced both a Super Bowl winning QB and an astronaut. If anyone can confirm astronauts for those other universities, please let me know.",

The regular season has real issues, its too long, guys are getting hurt too much, everybody is making so much money the only reason to have 82 games is because you make money from it, you go down to 70 games, you make less money. Guess what, Devin Book, instead of making 75 million in 2028, he'll make 73 million. He'll be fine.\"\n\n\"All this sh\\*t, everything they’re doing, they’re not serving the larger picture of what do fans want? How do we keep our players healthy? How do we have a competitive season from start to finish? How do we avoid over one-fourth of our league not giving a shi\\*t for the last two months? How do we fix this? And it’s the first time I really wondered, like, do we have the right guy running the league? Because he doesn’t seem interested in actually fixing real problems that everybody can see. And it’s not about like, ‘look at the NBA Cup. Oh, we created this thing.’ Your schedule is too long. You have to fix this. It’s too long. It should be 70 games.\"\n\n\"You might need a f\\*cking asshole at this point. You might need mid 2000s David Stern.\"",

Charles goes out there, puts in a pole lap forged by motorsport gods themselves, absolute filth of a quali, purple sectors everywhere, crowd losing their shit, and by lap 16 it’s “engine issue” or “box for hard tires in traffic” or some other strategically deranged nonsense that makes me want to scream into a carbon fiber pillow. Ferrari fans don’t watch races, we attend weekly trauma seminars with tire degradation PowerPoints and complimentary clown makeup. Meanwhile Max shows up like he accidentally wandered into a karting session, casually annihilates the field by 22 fucking seconds, and asks about the wind direction mid-race like he’s mildly bored. “Gap is 14 seconds.” To who? The fucking International Space Station? The man could start in reverse, serve a drive-through for breathing too confidently, and still win by a margin large enough to legally qualify as real estate. And Lando, bless his wholesome soul, is out here saying “ah it’s just unfortunate” like a polite British king while internally you know he’s screaming WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK into a McLaren beanbag because the second strategy finally works, a safety car appears like it was scripted by a chaotic intern with a grudge. Mercedes? Oh yeah, let’s talk about the bouncing era PTSD because I still hear “porpoising” in my nightmares. One minute they’re launching down the straight like a possessed dolphin on crack, the next Toto is on the pit wall looking like he’s calculating the economic impact of suffering while George sends it from three counties back and the stewards flip a coin to decide if it’s “hard racing” or “absolutely fucking illegal.” Speaking of stewards, what in the regulatory hell is that consistency? One driver exceeds track limits by half a toenail and it’s a 5-second penalty, two warnings, and public humiliation. Another driver divebombs like it’s Fast & Furious 12 and it’s “no further action.” I swear they’ve got a wheel backstage labeled “Warning,” “5 Seconds,” “10 Seconds,” “Grid Drop,” “Points Penalty,” and “lol get rekt.” Red Bull internal drama? Don’t worry, Twitter has a 48-tweet thread ready because someone stood slightly too far away from someone else in the paddock. Helmut blinks? Civil war. Christian adjusts his belt? Coup imminent. Adrian walks briskly? The end times are upon us. F1 fans analyze body language like it’s forensic fucking science and I’m just trying to understand how we ended up with another DRS train that looks like a cursed conga line of aerodynamic suffering. Sprint weekends are an absolute clusterfuck because now I need a goddamn spreadsheet to understand qualifying for a sprint that qualifies for nothing that qualifies for something that isn’t the actual race but still kind of matters unless it doesn’t. “Is this the race?” No. “But they’re racing.” Yes. “So—” Shut the fuck up, I don’t know anymore, none of us know, we’re all just pretending. And Crofty screaming “LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY WE GO” like the apocalypse just started while I nearly launch my coffee across the room because Turn 1 is about to become a reenactment of bumper cars with multimillion-dollar machinery. The midfield is pure feral chaos energy too, Alpine fighting itself like a dysfunctional family reunion, Haas popping up in P6 like a jump scare from hell, Williams quietly cooking like they’re about to drop a diss track on the entire grid. Every time someone says “best of the rest” I lose three months of my lifespan. And the memes have permanently rewired my brain because I cannot hear “box box” without experiencing spiritual damage, I can’t read “Plan F” without laughing like a deranged lunatic, and if someone says “it’s called motor racing” in public I will absolutely lose my fucking mind. Yet despite all this strategic nonsense, this high-speed soap opera of egos and engine penalties and steward roulette, I will still wake up at 7am like a sleep-deprived goblin with Wi-Fi whispering “this is the weekend.” This is the weekend Ferrari doesn’t implode, the safety car doesn’t materialize out of thin air like a chaotic deity, the stewards are consistent for five consecutive minutes, and someone new stands on the top step without a 14-page post-race document explaining why it doesn’t count. And when it inevitably goes sideways in the most dramatic, profanity-inducing, meme-generating way imaginable, I will scream, I will swear, I will type essays about tire deg and undercuts and absolute bullshit race control decisions like a caffeinated maniac… and then I will be right back next week because F1 isn’t just a sport, it’s a beautifully toxic, high-octane psychological experiment designed to see how much chaos a human being can endure while still loving every ridiculous, stress-filled, radio-bleeped, DRS-spamming, strategy-fumbling, absolutely unhinged fucking second of it. See you at Turn 1, you glorious bastards.",

Rather than trying to force your starter to figure it out, Dusty wisely passed the torch to Cason and that decision felt like it won the game for us. Cason provided a spark off the bench that got the offense going.\n\nI have full faith in Cadeau to get back to his usual self in future games and I also respect him for rooting on his teammates from the bench. I’m just glad to know I have a coach capable of making these really tough decisions in crucial moments.",
