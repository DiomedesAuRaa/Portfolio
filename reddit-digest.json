        "selftext": "This case predates NIL, the open transfer system, and the total unraveling of NCAA authority, but it’s a fascinating case to look at in hindsight. \n\nTurk appealed for his eligibility on the basis that the pandemic, which unfolded between the time he declared for the draft and the time the draft took place, prevented him from showcasing his ability. The NCAA, without any push from any courts, accepted his viewpoint and granted him the ability to return to college. \n\nAll in all, Turk played six years of college football, with one year as a transfer redshirt and one year being the 2020 season which did not count. His first foray into the NFL draft took place at the halfway point. After a freshman year in 2017 at Lafayette College, he transferred to ASU requiring him to sit out in 2018 (remember when players had to do this?) and then played the 2019 season at ASU. After the draft, he returned to ASU for the 2020 season, which did not count towards his eligibility, and then transferred to Oklahoma and played the 2021 and 2022 seasons there. He went through the draft a second time in 2023 and was also undrafted. \n\nhttps://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/29264277/arizona-state-punter-michael-turk-ncaa-eligibility-restored-going-undrafted-unsigned-nfl\n\nTurk is not the first player to go through the draft twice. Famously, Bo Jackson went through the draft twice after refusing to sign for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and sitting out the football season to play baseball instead. He would be drafted by the Raiders a year later. However, this is the first case I know of where a player went through the draft, returned to college after the draft, and then went through the draft again.",

As I write this, it's hard to really know what to feel, but for once - most people would be surprised - I don't have the answer lol! But, mostly I'm filled with so much joy and gratitude! While this chapter of being an \"NBA player\" is done, the game of basketball will forever be engrained in the DNA of my life. I've been in the NBA for more than half of my life, spanning three decades. It's crazy even saying that!! Playing basketball for a living has been an unbelievable blessing that also came with lots of responsibility. I embraced it all. The good and the bad. As a lifelong learner, leadership is hard and is not for the weak. Some will like you and many people won't. But the goal was always the goal, and my intentions were always sincere (Damn, I love competing!!)\n\n> \nIt feels really good knowing that I played and treated this game with the utmost respect since the day my dad introduced to me to it. It was the very first relationship I ever knew. Basketball gav me a reason to wake up at 5am and work out before school. It gave me a reason to find a way to get to the YMCA on snow days even when the roads were icy. It gave me a reason to be the little brother always trying to beat his big brother. It gave me a reason to earn good grades so I could have a chance to play in college. It gave me a reason to to score 61 points in a game even though my grandfather had just been killed. It gave me a reason to show up and rehab day after day after the meniscus tear, the jones fracture, the separated shoulder and the 5 hand surgeries...\n\n> \nThe game always gave me a reason to SHOW UP!!! And the true leaders and fighters know that that right there - showing up - is half of the battle.\nSo now with all the gratitude that I could possibly have... it's time for me to show up for others and in other ways. This last season I knew I couldn't do it unless I was at home with my family. Those six years away were a lot of sacrifice for all of us and I knew that had to come to an end. And I now know wholeheartedly the best teammate I can be is to Jada, Chris II and Cam!!\n\n> \nI am so excited to take with me to the next chapter all the incredible things basketball has taught me. And more importantly that the people I have been blessed to meet through basketball have taught me.\nTo all the teammates, coaches, staff, executives and most of all family. I can't begin to thank you enough...but the good news is I'll now have much more time to start!\nAnd the biggest thanks of all goes to the man upstairs...if you know this and are reading feel free to finish...\"God is Good, All the Time and All the Time.....\"\n\nScreenshots in case Instagram is behind a login wall: https://imgur.com/a/eWoMQr1\n\nInstagram / official post: \n\nFirst slide: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/DUtPyqHiaxe/?img_index=1\n\nSecond slide: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/DUtPyqHiaxe/?img_index=2\n\nThird slide: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/DUtPyqHiaxe/?img_index=3\n\nLast slide: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/DUtPyqHiaxe/?img_index=4",

I was fortunate to meet him.”\n\n\"I think he made a statement and afterwards apologised. I will not comment on what Sir Jim Ratcliffe said because after that - all around the world it is a problem that we have - all around the countries.”\n\n\"We treat immigrant people and other people that come from other countries - that is a problem that our countries have. It is a big big big problem because the fact that I am Catalan and you are British - what influence we had when we were born was mum and dad, right? That's why we were born there.”\n\n\"Everybody wants to have a better life. Every person wants to have a perspective to have a better future for themselves, for their families or their friends. Sometimes opportunities come in the place that you were born and the place that you go. Today before it was so difficult to travel but today in one hour you can be everywhere.”\n\n\"That is why the place you were born doesn't make a difference. The moment we start, we have a lot of work to do about that. Does it make me feel like I am better than you because I am Catalan? No.”\n\n\"My education when I was born, when I travel in Mexico, live in Qatar, live in Italy, live in England or Germany - that is just the benefit of my personality and how I grew up. I met incredible nice people travelling and that is what it is about but don't make me feel bad just for the fact I was born in one place and different from the other.”\n\n\"Most people run away from their countries for the problems that are in their country, not because they want to leave.”\n\n\"The more we embrace other cultures, truly embrace it, then we will have a better society - I do not have any doubts about that.\"",

        "selftext": "With the NFL draft approaching, I, like most of you, start digging deep into players. We identify the Lions' needs, read about the prospects, track combine results, follow pro days and visits, and F5 the rumor mill as the day approaches.\n\nIn that process, it's natural to have players you prefer. The draft is like Christmas - we all have our wish lists and toys that we hope to get. But keep in mind one important thing:\n\nYou have zero input.\n\nI know that seems snide, and obvious. But these next couple months are going to be an endless stream of people \"convinced\" that the Lions' best pick would be Draft Crush X, or that they absolutely have to draft Position Y, or that they should execute Pick Trade Z. The reality, though is this: \n\nYou don't know shit.\n\nAnd hey, neither do I. It kinda sucks to admit. Part of being a fan is feeling like you're part of the team. It's the illusion they sell you, the booze they feed you.\n\nBut you're not.\n\nWe don't have access to their scouting reports. We don't talk to players' coaches and teammates. 99% of us do the same research everyone else is doing, which is just listening to self-proclaimed draft experts. But all that most of those guys have done is watch a few highlights, take a few bribes from agents and publicists, and then regurgitate what all of the other experts are saying.\n\nIt's fun. I won't deny that. I do it for a reason.\n\nBut we don't know shit. And the \"experts\" only have passing familiarity with shit.\n\nSo go ahead and figure out what your personal draft board is - which you realistically probably only spent a dozen hours or so on - because it's enjoyable. And go ahead and figure out what order they need to take the various positions, because that's a fun puzzle as well.\n\nBut if Holmes trades up in round 1 for TE Kenyon Sadiq, don't say I didn't warn you.",
