Let's be exceedingly clear: the hitting was not the problem.\n\n\nThe Mets failed because their pitching was *abysmal* in the second half. There was a stretch of like six weeks in which David Peterson was the only starter to make it out of the fifth inning. We traded for all-star closer Ryan Helsley, who promptly became the worst reliever in baseball. Our flamethrower setup man Ryne Stanek was almost as bad. The team had the best offensive month *in team history* in August, yet finished with a *losing record* for the month. That's inconceivable. \n\n\nLack of chemistry among stars surely doesn't help. I'm sure it did make a difference. But someone explain how the left fielder and shortstop not getting along has no appreciable impact on the hitting but somehow absolutely decimates the entire pitching staff. It doesn't make sense.\n\n\nAs is the case with every team, winning solves all the problems, and losing exacerbates them. I don't think the team tanked because they lacked chemistry. I think their horrible performance made everything tense and *brought out* the lack of chemistry. ",

They have the 72nd most talented roster in the country and they are now 14-0 and #1 in the country. Yes, theres NIL/portal but its not like they’re bringing in 5 star guys. Its mostly players who were with Cignetti at JMU and overlooked 3 star guys. \n\nIts Moneyball on steroids. And lots of good coaching. \n\nEven if they lose, its already impressive.
