        "selftext": "To me, this is LeBron’s most impactful single season of his career, end to end. The cavs won 66 games, and LeBron’s on court +15 net rating was the highest of his career, which includes seasons with Wade + Bosh, and Kyrie + Love. The Cavs had some strong role players like Varejao, Ben Wallace, Delonte, but no real top 20 type players. LeBron’s **on-off that year was also a career high +21**\n\nFor some context on how high a +15 net rating is, here’s the some superstar seasons since 1997 who **have crossed: +15 net (only started being recorded since 1997)**:\n\n- 2005 Duncan, +17. Notable teammates include *Manu, Tony Parker, Robert Horry*\n\n- 2015-2017 Steph, +17, +18, +17. Notable teammates include *Draymond, KD, Klay, Iguodala*\n\n- 2025/2026 Shai, +17, +18.3. Notable teammates include *Chet, J-dub* then role players like *I-hart, Caruso, Cason Wallace*\n\n- 2020 Giannis, +16. Notable teammates include *Middleton, Lopez*, and role players like *George Hill, Bledsoe, DDV*\n\n- 1998 Shaq, +16. Notable teammates include *Eddie Jones, Nick Van Excel, Kobe Bryant, Robert Horry*\n\n- 2008 KG: +16.5. Notable teammates include *Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, Rondo, Tony Allen*. \n\nHere are some players who have never hit the +15 mark in a regular season:\n\nJokic, Kobe, Dirk, Harden, CP3, Nash, Tatum\n\nTo go deeper into how much impact LeBron had on those Cavs, RAPM is a well known statistical approach that attempts to go beyond on just court and on/off net rating by adjusting for what teammates you play with, and the strength of lineups you faced. LeBron’s 3-year 2009-2011 stretch is the **2nd highest stretch since 1997**. His 5-year 2007-2011 stretch is the **highest since 1997**. https://www.nbarapm.com/player/LeBron_James\n\nIn the playoffs across 3 series, LeBron then averaged an absolutely mind boggling **47.5 pts/100** on +10 efficiency adjusting for opponent defense, which is the highest playoff scoring rate of all time within a minimum of 3 series played. This included a 38, 8, 8 series against the number 1 defense Orlando Magic, where the Cavs posted a monstrous +10 offense when LeBron was on court, but also got cooked by a Magic team somehow shooting 41% from 3 and Dwight cooking Varejao/Ilgauskas",

I'd see him on the 27th or 28th usually, with his extended family\n\nBut all Christmas Eve my mind and heart felt so heavy with thoughts and memories of him, which took me by surprise.

Staying up late to watch the Boxing Day test. My dad worked a lot and sometimes even worked Christmas, but then there would be that moment he came home, too\n. \nI think it gets me too, what he's lost. We've lost him, but it hurts to know that he'll never again have the joy of Christmas, of seeing your family, of eating, drinking and being merry.
