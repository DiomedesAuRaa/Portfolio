And then he didn't. The emotions I felt in that minute were some other shit. Will never forget how dirty they did us here.\n\n  \nHe is the shining light on this team idgaf. Yeah maybe if he could run instead of grounding passes on dead plays we would have some more yards, but fuck all that. He is the GOAT of this team rn. The most important cog in the machine. The glue guy. The reason our pass game is Top 3 in yards and Offense is Top 2 in points scored despite the record. Whatever you want to call him.\n\n  \nI just really really really hope OUR YEAR is a year where he is at the helm. He deserves it. There goes my hero.",
