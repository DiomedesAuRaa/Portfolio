Because the team has not yet started operating as the Las Vegas Athletics, it cannot easily produce the kind of marketplace evidence, such as sales figures, advertising spend, media recognition, and consumer perception, that would normally overcome a descriptiveness refusal.\n\n> There is also a clear legal precedent that prior trademark registrations do not guarantee approval of new trademarks. From the USPTO’s perspective, Oakland Athletics and Las Vegas Athletics are legally different marks, and the agency is well within its rights to hold that line and deny these new trademark applications.\n\n> Still, this case has the potential to push the law in a new direction. At a practical level, it is hard to argue that the public would perceive ‘Las Vegas Athletics’ as anything other than the existing MLB franchise. That opens the door to more creative legal arguments, but pursuing them would likely require an appeal to federal court.\n\n> One other option at this point would be for the team to retain a survey expert. A properly designed consumer perception survey could provide powerful evidence that the public overwhelmingly associates ‘Las Vegas Athletics’ with the Athletics ownership group and its MLB team. That type of data can move the needle with examiners, especially with these types of refusals.\n\n> Do I expect the Athletics to ultimately secure these registrations?\n\n> Yes.",

What could that look like realistically?\n\n  \nIn order to be fair to the owners when relocating their team, we will relocate each team based on their Metropolitan Statistical Area to the Canadian metro area of the same rank. For example: Philadelphia, PA is the 9th largest MSA in America so they will move to Hamilton, ON which is the 9th largest in Canada. We will also relocate the Blue Jays south of the border for fairness.

        "selftext": "Hélène Hendriks does not have fond memories of Diego Costa. The former Atlético Madrid striker behaved rudely during an interview in the coronavirus era.\n\n\n\nHendriks was a reporter during the Champions League round of 16 match between Liverpool and Atlético (2-3) in March 2020. While the Netherlands was already in lockdown, the stadium was still full. “In the end, 41 of the people who were in that stadium died of COVID-19,” Hendriks said in the HNM podcast.\n\n\n\nAfter the match, Hendriks conducted interviews. “First I had Virgil van Dijk, then Diego Costa came. Do you know what Diego Costa did? He walked up and deliberately coughed in the face of everyone standing there.” The presenter found the striker's action distasteful. “I don't get angry easily, but I wanted to run after him and say, ‘What are you doing to me?’”\n\n\n\n“He coughed right in my face,” emphasizes Hendriks, who was not wearing a face mask at the time. “But I was attached to a wire for the connection with the Netherlands, and I was walking behind Diego Costa, so the whole camera fell over. I didn't know what had happened to me. I thought it was outrageous.” Two days later, Hendriks had the coronavirus, she says. “What a jerk! What an asshole!” says Noa Vahle.\n\n\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)",
