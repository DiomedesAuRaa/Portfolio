But multiple people familiar with the process said any buyout would involve Darvish giving up the bulk of what he would be owed and that the Padres are set to realize a significant savings over the next three years. That money is intended to be used to help make the team better.\n\n>“As far as leaving lots of money,” Darvish said in a recent interview, “I look at it as that was never mine to begin with, especially considering the money I haven’t physically earned yet.”\n\nAll-timer class move from a player. Could have a significant impact on the Padres, considering reports that they've been strapped for cash.\n\nEdit: Given that this comment is at the top I feel I should add the statement Yu's agent has put out: \n\n>“Yu has not made a final decision yet. This is a complicated matter we are still working through.”\n\nI believe Twitter links are banned here but the update can be found on Feinsand, Nightengale, Dennis Lin, and Alden Gonzalez's pages right now.",

I think it was the number one factor in Dan’s search for Offensive Coordinator. Willingness to set up a drive in which fourth down is thought of as one more play is the Detroit Lions style and Petzing really embodied that philosophy as well in 2023 when the cardinals were the most healthy. That’s just my opinion, I don’t think Ben Johnson had anything to do with the decision.",
