In a normal season, yes, the 90% would be more accurate.  However, the north end zone has been under construction for over a year now, so the capacity of the stadium was reduced down to 33,000.

        "selftext": "The collapse: BC was riding an unbeaten season and was no 1. A berth in the Sugar Bowl and possible national title was in sight. All they had to do was win their last game of the season against their wee little rival Holy Cross at Fenway Park and its all sunshine and rainbows. HC was unranked and sporting a 4-4-1 record, BC is so confident that celebrations are already planned and possible parades are being discussed. You all know how this one goes....HC beats the \\*\\*\\*\\* out of BC 55-12. Boston is crestfallen, all celebrations are canceled, and the players go back to their rooms cussing and defeated.\n\nWhy it was lucky: That very night that BC got curb stomped, their victory party was planned at the famous Boston nightspot:  The Cocoanut Grove. Never heard of it? Well it was thanks to being overpacked the first thanksgiving since Pearl Harbor and a underage busboy accidently lighting a match in a gas fume-ridden room that the whole place ignited and became the worst nightclub fire in history. Due to having only one faulty turnstile front door and no other exits nearly 500 people are dead. The owner Barney Welansky is busted for numerous violations which due to good ol' Boston corruption he was allowed to operate until disaster struck. Welansky would die just 4 years later due to cancer after being set free from prison just before he dies, in his interview he said he wished he had died in the fire as well.  Numerous heads roll, building laws are strictly recalibrated and everyone forgets about the disaster that happened at Fenway earlier that day. Ill bet you those BC players sometimes thought to themselves that blowing it on such a grand scale ended up saving their lives.\n\nIll link two articles for you to peruse the subject: [https://news.holycross.edu/stories/holy-cross-footballs-historic-upset-against-boston-college-75-years-later](https://news.holycross.edu/stories/holy-cross-footballs-historic-upset-against-boston-college-75-years-later)\n\n[https://pressbreak.substack.com/p/the-greatest-days-in-college-football](https://pressbreak.substack.com/p/the-greatest-days-in-college-football)",

        "selftext": "I recently made a post about which teams had the best home field advantage (HFA). [That post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1pki092/home_field_advantage_improved_methodology_w_fpi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) was a measure of which teams gain the most points when playing at home. So I took a different approach to measuring this. Now I want to look at a simpler question: How hard is it to win at a given stadium. This approach will inevitably be *heavily influenced* by how good a team has been over the time frame, but still helps us answer the question.\n\nLet me be very clear: this list is NOT a ranking of which teams should have the largest \"home field advantage\" value applied when handicapping games. Those values can be found in the previous post. This is a list of the hardest places to play, period.\n\n**Methodology:** Looking at all FBS games played in the past 20 seasons, I calculated the \"expected performance\" of all opponents at a given stadium based on their performance in other road games. Then I calculated how many points better or worse teams did at a given stadium than the same teams did in their other road games. Only teams with at least 50 home games during that timeframe are included.\n\nThe correlation of this data with home win % is 0.49 and the correlation with average home margin is 0.47\n\n|Rank|TeamName|Stadium Name|Points Above Average|Conference|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Alabama|Bryant-Denny Stadium|9.6|SEC|\n|2|Ohio State|Ohio Stadium|9.0|Big Ten|\n|3|Oklahoma|Memorial Stadium (Norman, OK)|8.7|SEC|\n|4|Oregon|Autzen Stadium|8.5|Big Ten|\n|5|LSU|Tiger Stadium (LA)|7.7|SEC|\n|6|Georgia|Sanford Stadium|7.7|SEC|\n|7|Clemson|Memorial Stadium (Clemson, SC)|7.6|ACC|\n|8|USC|Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|7.1|Big Ten|\n|9|Michigan|Michigan Stadium|6.7|Big Ten|\n|10|Penn State|Beaver Stadium|6.6|Big Ten|\n|11|Notre Dame|Notre Dame Stadium|6.5|Independent|\n|12|Wisconsin|Camp Randall Stadium|6.2|Big Ten|\n|13|Florida|Ben Hill Griffin Stadium|5.8|SEC|\n|14|Washington|Husky Stadium|5.7|Big Ten|\n|15|Utah|Rice-Eccles Stadium|5.7|Big 12|\n|16|Texas|DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium|5.6|SEC|\n|17|Boise State|Albertsons Stadium|5.6|MWC|\n|18|Oklahoma State|Boone Pickens Stadium|5.6|Big 12|\n|19|Kansas State|Bill Snyder Family Stadium|5.4|Big 12|\n|20|TCU|Amon G.

For first-round picks, the fifth-year option amount isn’t fixed just by draft slot anymore. Instead, it has four tiers:\n\nBasic Tier: lowest salary, based mostly on positional averages.\n\nPlaytime Tier: higher than basic, based on playing time thresholds.\n\nOne Pro Bowl Tier: earns a salary equal to the transition tag at his position.\n\nMultiple Pro Bowls Tier: earns a salary equal to the franchise tag at his position. \n\nFWIW, alternate Pro Bowl selections do not count towards this. So Drake Maye for example, who was like the 8th backup Pro Bowler last year but a legit Pro Bowler this year, only has one pro Bowl counting towards his 5th year option raise.",

We've lost him, but it hurts to know that he'll never again have the joy of Christmas, of seeing your family, of eating, drinking and being merry.
