Not only that, they were able to manage their cap sheet well and escape the luxury tax entirely. Nearly all of their players can pass, shoot, or defend. And they run good offense.\n\nIn the meantime, the Lakers manage assets poorly, have missed on draft picks for a long time now, and spend plays complaining to refs, not hustling, and giving up loose balls and offensive rebounds. Plus Luka, Lebron, and AR often hold the ball too long and waste time. \n\nIt's just a noticeable contrast in how well each franchise is run. Boston has such an elite culture from the top to bottom where everyone is bought in.",

The former NFL quarterback and XFL offensive coordinator only arrived in Detroit last offseason, but he quickly became invaluable to the team’s operation after* ***Ben Johnson****‘s departure.*\n\n*Had the Dolphins hired Gradkowski, he would have been tasked with identifying and working with Miami’s next starting quarterback, as* [*the team is expected to part ways*](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2026/02/dolphins-hope-to-trade-qb-tua-tagovailoa) *with* [***Tua Tagovailoa***](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TagoTu00.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2026-02-12_pfr) *this offseason.

Gradkowski will likely play a key role in the Lions’ transition to new offensive coordinator* ***Drew Petzing****.*\n\n*The Lions will not be able to block Gradkowski from future coordinator interview requests, and the club’s desire to keep him suggests that they believe he is heading in that direction. He has not been a coach for very long, but he led the XFL’s St. Louis Battlehawks to strong finishes as their offensive coordinator in 2023 and 2024. That play-calling success could be an attractive asset to other teams in future hiring cycles.*\n\n",
