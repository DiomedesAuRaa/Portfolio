This is nice and pure and shows how emotional his father is. So for anyone who wants to rip the guy for what eliminated the Phils I get it, but all I can think about is how *this* poor guy felt when his son made such a crucial mistake. By the looks of it he’s an empathetic guy and clearly loves his kid. If this guy was this into it for his debut you can only imagine how he felt during that play and subsequent hate that followed. \n\nAnd I say all of this as a Mets fan who can’t stand my rivals. But you never want to see a guy go through that, and seeing his father here adds one more layer to that. \n\nHaving empathy is an important human quality.",

Because the team has not yet started operating as the Las Vegas Athletics, it cannot easily produce the kind of marketplace evidence, such as sales figures, advertising spend, media recognition, and consumer perception, that would normally overcome a descriptiveness refusal.\n\n> There is also a clear legal precedent that prior trademark registrations do not guarantee approval of new trademarks. From the USPTO’s perspective, Oakland Athletics and Las Vegas Athletics are legally different marks, and the agency is well within its rights to hold that line and deny these new trademark applications.\n\n> Still, this case has the potential to push the law in a new direction. At a practical level, it is hard to argue that the public would perceive ‘Las Vegas Athletics’ as anything other than the existing MLB franchise. That opens the door to more creative legal arguments, but pursuing them would likely require an appeal to federal court.\n\n> One other option at this point would be for the team to retain a survey expert. A properly designed consumer perception survey could provide powerful evidence that the public overwhelmingly associates ‘Las Vegas Athletics’ with the Athletics ownership group and its MLB team. That type of data can move the needle with examiners, especially with these types of refusals.\n\n> Do I expect the Athletics to ultimately secure these registrations?\n\n> Yes.",

(And those teams don’t have Cade)\n\nWhat happens when we got against a team with amazing interior defense like Cleveland? We sub in players like Dannis to bomb them from outside\n\nWhat happens when the other team is a bit older and slow? Ivey speeds past everyone and hits a ton of easy transition lays \n\nWhat about when the starting lineup is off all together ? Sasser gets his own bucket off the dribble \n\nObviously there are more situations where players like BBall Paul and Levert shine (although Levert has been off lately) but remeber Levert is 38% from three this season. \n\nWe are young. Our window is HUGE as long as Cade and Duren are here. Everyone on this team understands their roles and are ready to play any given night and don’t complain to the media when they are a healthy scratch. They understand that some nights aren’t going to be theirs. They play hard defensively no matter what the score is.This is the team others dream of. No reason to mess it up for an offensive player who takes away from the defensive identity of the team and makes others work even harder to compensate their lack of defensive focus. ",
