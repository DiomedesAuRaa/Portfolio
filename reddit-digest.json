        "selftext": "Oliver Glasner has conceded that Marc Guéhi will leave Crystal Palace for Manchester City this month for the right price.\n\nCity are considering a move for Guéhi, the 25-year-old England centre back, after their defence was weakened by injuries to Josko Gvardiol and Rúben Dias last weekend. Guéhi, whose Palace contract ends this summer, has also been linked with Liverpool, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.\n\nGlasner said last month that he expected Guéhi to stay at Palace until the end of this season, but admitted on Tuesday that he could leave in the January window.  \n\n“If a player feels too good for a club, it is better to sell him, and if a player is not good enough for a club, you also have to sell him,” Glasner said. “To get the best out of your squad, it must be a match.”\n\nAsked whether Guéhi and City are a potential “match” in January, Glasner said: “It could be. I’m not so naive as not to know that if a massive offer comes from City and Marc wants to do it, it will happen.”\n\n“Nothing in life is one-dimensional,” Glasner said. “Let’s say you have a nice car but you need money because it’s cold and a window [at home] is broken, and somebody offers you crazy money for your car. You say, ‘No, I don’t want to sell my car. I love my car. But I don’t want to freeze.’ Then you say, ‘If I can get the window and even a new roof, you can have the car. But I would like to keep it.’\n\n“It’s the same with Marc. Everybody wants him to play for Crystal Palace, sign a new contract and stay here for ever.”\n\n“On the other side, the contract ends this summer and if somebody is coming and you are freezing, there will be a moment when the club says, ‘Now the financial issue is more important than the sporting issue and we have to do it.”\n\n“There will be a threshold where if Marc says he wants to leave and the money is above the threshold, it will happen.”\n\n“The money was not above the threshold,” he said of Guéhi’s collapsed move to Liverpool. “Maybe it was close. If somebody had offered £80million for Marc and Marc said he wanted to go, then Marc wouldn’t be a Crystal Palace player.”",

            "body": "That last pod was just peak homer Bill. He ran through 29 teams and the Celtics came up in like half of the discussions for other teams. Then when he got to the Celtics finally he prefaced the conversation by saying he'd already spoken about them a lot so there wasn't much left to say, and then spent like 5x the time talking about them. \n\nThen after going back to football later in the pod, he said he'd abstain from the MVP talk because he already did it, and then Immediately jumped in to hammer home the same points he'd already made. I usually don't mind the homer stuff but god damn, dude. Find the line.",

        "selftext": "This latest episode with Goldsberry really made me re-evaluate how I think about Bill's NBA knowledge. He keeps relating things to the Celtics, which makes me think that he isn't watching teams equally. Instead, it feels like he watches the Celtics a ton but probably only watches other teams when it's an interesting matchup or if the team has a player he likes. It's clear that a lot of his NBA takes are primarily given through a blatant Celtics lens, which is really jarring to hear as someone who has been listening for a decent amount of time.\n\nCan any oldheads who have listened to Bill for a longer amount of time (perhaps a week or maybe even a month) weigh in on this? When did he abandon his in-depth analyses in favor of making all these comparisons to Celtics players and analogies to action movies?",

Would he play over Hauser?\"\n* \\#26 Nets: mentions \"the Suns coach\" and says he and Mazzulla are in the running for coach of the year\n* \\#23 Bulls: Kirk actually mentions the Celtics, Bill doesn't continue on that thread, shockingly.\n* \\#22 Mavs: The Mavs should be worried that Cooper Flagg might come to the Celtics in 4 years! His Mom is a huge Celtics fan!\n* \\#20 Trail Blazers: Mentions how well Clingan played against, you guessed it, the Celtics. Then when Goldsberry is mentioning their good wins, Bill mentions again how they beat the Celtics.\n* \\#18 Clippers: Mentions Jaylen Brown's performance against them recently. Later says that Harden did nothing after the Celtics knocked him down in their game.\n* \\#16 Warriors: They're 20th in offense. They need to do what the Celtics are doing, who are 2nd in offense and getting 130-140 points a game. Then later talks about how the Celtics offense works with Queta and Garza setting picks for their guards as opposed to what Horford is giving the Warriors. Then, he goes to the Celtics a **third** time, mentioning how the Warriors don't have a heat check guy like Simons.\n* \\#13 76ers: Mentions rooting against Philly (from a Celtics standpoint)\n* \\#9 Suns: This is the worst one. The Suns are coached like the Celtics (he again does not say the name of the Suns coach). The Suns have a guy in Booker who can go toe to toe with the other team's best player, just like Jaylen Brown on the Celtics. The Suns have a bunch of guys with something to prove, like the Celtics. Bill wants us to know that he isn't comparing these teams by accident.\n* \\#8 Knicks: Kirk mentions the Celtics and Bill gets excited about a rematch in the playoffs. Bill also talks about how the Celtics are a bad matchup for the Knicks.\n* \\#6 Celtics: Bill starts by admitting he's talked about them too much so far, but they still spend 8+ minutes.\n* \\#3 Spurs: Kirk mentions Kornet and Bill talks about how the Celtics miss him. Kirk then asks if the Celtics should make a trade to strengthen their frontcourt.\n* \\#1 Thunder: When talking about OKC's shooting woes, he relates things back to the Celtics-Clippers game he attended.\n\nI know he's a huge homer but this is genuinely the worst I've ever heard from him on what was supposed to be a discussion of the entire league.",
