        "title": "Why Indiana actually went 3-9, NOT 16-0.",

        "selftext": "So as we all know, the Indiana Hoosiers just went 16-0 to win their first national title in school history. However, in this post I'll break down why that is actually impossible and they actually went 3-9.\n\n1. Indiana's first 3 games were against FCS teams. So let's say they didn't play any of them, and instead played actually COMPETETIVE teams. Well, who knows what would have happened? So, we can automatically mark those down as losses.\n2. Their Big 10 Opener was against Illinois, who put up an atrocious performance against them, losing 63-10. However, we can ALSO pencil that one down as a loss. Why? Because the next week, Fernando Mendoza lead a game winning drive against Iowa, and won 20-15. We all know game winning drives are pure luck, not skill, so that is technically a loss. But as a Nebraska fan, I refuse to give Iowa a win in this situation, so instead I will give it to Illinois.\n3. Indiana is now 1-4 walking into Eugene against Oregon, where they win 30-20. However, that one is also a loss because Oregon was ranked #3 at the time, so for Indiana to win that, that would mean they were at minimum a #2 team that night. #2 teams have national championship hopes, however 4 loss teams don't. So it just wouldn't make sense for Indiana to win that one. 1-5.\n4. Then they play Michigan State, who put up the second best performance against Indiana as an unranked team. But, actually it's the best performance they put up, because we already marked Iowa as a loss, remember? And if your a team putting up the best performance against someone who's 1-5 as an unranked team, that pretty much means a win right? So now, Indiana is 1-6.\n5. Then they blew out UCLA 56-6, but that wouldn't really make a whole lotta sense, because UCLA was on a 3 game win streak, just having upset #2 Penn State. Therefore, it wouldn't be logical for UCLA to end all that momentum against a 1-6 team. Indiana's 1-7.\n6. Then the very next week, they play @ Maryland who they blew out 55-10. That's only because Indiana was motivated and had a lot of momentum with their fraudulent wins, you can only imagine they wouldn't have that much motivation as a 1-7 team. So we can count that as a one possession win for Indiana. BUT, since it was AT Maryland, Maryland got that home field advantage, so that means a loss for the Hoosiers.\n7. Then Indiana played Penn State which they won out of pure luck. This is because that crazy catch on that game winning drive was improbable, because what if there was just a slight gust of wind, and blew the receiver just a few inches to the side? Wouldn't had been a catch, and instead out of bounds, so Indiana would have lost. 1-9.\n8. The next 2 games we can count as wins, because as a Nebraska fan I can't give Wisconsin a win, and according to my perfect algorithm, Purdue was the worst team in the Big 10 and Indiana was the 2nd worst team, so Purdue would have lost.\n9. A 3-9 team obviously can't make the conference championship or the playoffs, so all those extra wins disappear.\n\nAnd there you have it folks, the perfect and most logical explanation for how Indiana's season should have went.",

And that’s the real problem. \n\nHave whatever opinion you want of the new autobid rules: the rot is much deeper than that. A committee of financially invested parties is insane and ripe for corruption. \n\nAnd the rot was obvious this year. No not because Miami jumped Notre Dame - as silly as the way it happened might’ve been it at least fit their stated rules. No the rot was obvious with Alabama jumping Notre Dame and staying there. \n\nWe all know what we saw: Bama struggle to beat a losing record Auburn team and jump a ND that sailed to victory. Maybe a rational actor could’ve had Bama higher before those games but nothing in them suggested Bama should rise. The inescapable conclusion is that the committee rigged the rankings last year. And that’s ignoring them ignoring the blowout loss to Georgia. \n\nSolution: Bring back the computers. They’re objective. They can’t be rigged. Or bring back the AP Poll. It’s much harder to rig and does not have concentrated financial stakes in the rankings. But the committee cannot be trusted. They will for better or worse make sure the rankings help the Big Ten and SEC make money at the expense of fairness. ",

For those who want a summary:\n\nGrizzlies Owner Robert Pera has his entire networth ($30b) tied to his company, Ubiquity, that sells WiFi equipment.\n\nThis WiFi equipment is showing up on the frontlines of the Ukraine-Russia war in shocking numbers. Alleged that 80% of Russia's communication network on the frontline relies on these devices. The video has pictures, video, and Russian soldiers on telegram begging for donations like twitch streamers so they can buy more.\n\nRussia is under sanctions, so it should be strictly illegal to sell devices like this to them. His company got in trouble for doing the exact same thing in 2014 when his devices started showing up in Iran, and the US Government fined them $500k, small because it was a first time offense. Grizzlies Owner said if this happened again, he'd be fucked.\n\nIn the video, they show how easy it is for Ubiquity devices to be bought from third party sellers in Russia. Ubiquity has basically no sales team of its own, it relies on these third party sellers and washes their hands clean of wherever they might end up. This is one way to cut your costs, have no compliance officers.\n\nThey even talk to an american third party seller, and pose as a Russian trying to buy $80k worth of devices. They set them up with the transaction, by sending them to Turkey first, then Russia. This is blatant sanctions violation, like a textbook example.\n\nVideo ends with Pablo Torres asking if Adam Silver is fining Ja Morant for holding a gun, what should he do with the Grizzlies owner who's evading sanctions (allegedly) making millions off the war in Ukraine while on Team Russia.",

        "selftext": "A country where safety is under threat from federal violence on the streets is not fit to stage soccer’s showpiece event\n\nRemoving the United States as co-host of the 2026 World Cup would hurt for pretty much everyone. Fans would miss out on seeing the sport’s pinnacle in their home towns (or somewhere nearby). Cities and businesses small and large would lose the financial benefits they had banked on. It would be a logistical and political nightmare on an international scale, the likes of which have never been seen before in sports. It would be eminently sad. And it would be entirely justified.\n\nIt brings me no pleasure to say this. The United States has been eager to host a men’s World Cup for more than a decade and a half. The desire survived and even grew after 2010’s failure to out-bid Russia and Qatar (in public and behind closed doors) for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. With hosting rights for 2026 later secured alongside Canada and Mexico, the US soccer scene prepared to show off that the sport is now part of the nation’s fabric, 32 years after hosting the tournament for the first time in 1994. Soccer’s growing popularity in America has helped inspire other US sports to try new formats, encouraged us to engage more fully with the world in a sporting context, and has been at the center of conversations about our society and culture. The 2026 World Cup was seen as the best chance for the world to fully experience not just how much the US has improved at soccer, but how much soccer has improved the US.\n\nI have not been immune to this Pollyannaish outlook. Much of my career covering American soccer has been predicated on the idea that the sport will continue to grow in the US. The 2026 World Cup is central to that hope. I can admit that I have a vested interest in this tournament’s success. As a lifelong fan, the World Cup landing here was a dream come true. As a professional, I hoped it would create millions of new North American soccer fans who will want to read and watch and listen to journalism about the sport for the rest of their lives.\n\nPerhaps I was naive. The tournament may create some of those fans, but at what cost? Exorbitant ticket prices have cut out the game’s grassroots. Onerous demands on cities have siphoned public money. Fifa has boosted an openly corrupt administration at every turn. Now wanton federal violence has made it difficult to justify having the World Cup here at all. Safety, justice, freedom, the continued functioning of society – these are all under threat. Even to many soccer fans in the US, the game once called “the most important of the least important things” now seems just plain unimportant.\n\nFederal agents have killed two innocent people in Minneapolis in the last three weeks. Neither was threatening the paramilitary forces who shot them. We know these things because we have seen them play out on video after sickening video, from multiple angles, slowed down and refocused and analysed. Yet the most senior governmental figures want us to believe that Renee Good and Alex Pretti were “domestic terrorists”. That they were, in fact the aggressors – in cold contrast to the mountain of available evidence. It would be reasonable to assume that those who disregard the truth so blatantly can also not be trusted to host a safe and secure World Cup.\n\nAnd then there is the wider picture. Thirty-two people died in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody in 2025 alone. The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom dedicated to tracking US gun violence, reports that immigration officers shot at people 19 times since the start of the crackdown – figures it assumes are an undercount. These include three killings in 2025, now up to at least five with the Minnesota deaths. Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has resulted in more detentions of people with no criminal record than any other category – despite its stated aim of ridding the country of criminals and claimed successes in doing so. The raids resulting in all of this have largely targeted Democratic-leaning metro areas – which 10 of the 11 US World Cup host cities are (the Dallas metroplex being the one outlier). Yet “the most important message that football can convey right now is one of peace and unity,” Fifa president Gianni Infantino said last year.\n\nHow can soccer do that when its showpiece event is in a country led by an administration intent on division? A country that has captured a foreign leader, possibly in violation of international law. A country that has threatened supposed allies with military action over control of a foreign territory. A country that has picked seemingly endless fights, including with its World Cup cohosts – the very countries it’s meant to be standing alongside and welcoming the world’s soccer fans.\n\nAre these the actions of a safe country, prepared to handle an influx of foreign visitors? Is this the kind of place you’d expect someone would want to spend many thousands of dollars to visit, even before they’ve ponied up for the games themselves? I can’t believe I’m about to say this, but I sympathise with Sepp Blatter on this one.\n\nThere have been discussions of a boycott in some form; a mild clamor, if that. If that actually happens among enough countries, Fifa’s hand could be forced. But as justified as that would be, that’s hard to even imagine. Holding World Cups in autocratic or destructive countries is nothing new. A boycott would mean revenue lost and a schedule that will be near-impossible to reconfigure. And there’s a feeling at soccer’s highest levels that, no matter which government Fifa cosies up to, the sport itself will escape unscathed.\n\n“With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them,” Concacaf president Victor Montagliani said last year at a conference. “Football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans.”\n\nBut in the meantime, football’s main event is at least partly under this administration’s control. Trump himself said last year that if cities are deemed to be too dangerous, or otherwise unfit for hosting, “We’re going to move the event to some place where it’s going to be appreciated and safe.”\n\nTrump, of course, meant moving World Cup matches to other US cities. But it would be hard to argue if the World Cup was moved out of the US entirely.",

Blatter’s endorsement of Pieth’s comments comes in the wake of the death of a second US citizen, Alex Pretti, last weekend.\n\nThe World Cup is due to be hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico from 11 June to 19 July.\n\n“What we are seeing domestically – the marginalisation of political opponents, abuses by immigration services, et. – hardly encourages fans to go there,” Pieth said in an interview with Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger last week.\n\n“For fans, just one piece of advice: avoid the United States! You’ll get a better view on television anyway. Upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don’t behave properly with the authorities, they will be immediately sent home. If they’re lucky …”\n\nBlatter stepped down as Fifa president in 2015 amid several scandals and was replaced by Gianni Infantino, who has forged close ties with Donald Trump.\n\nBlatter and former Uefa chief Michel Platini were last year acquitted definitively on charges stemming from a delayed payment of 2m Swiss francs ($2.5m) Fifa made to Platini in 2011 for consultancy services.\n\nFormer France star Platini said earlier this month that Infantino has “become more of an autocrat” and “he likes the rich and powerful”.",

You can tell it’s completely by design. \n\nThey’ll spend the entire game trying to play fast enough to draw fouls. You’ll also have the issue of the refs being afraid of Izzo and his team will draw one foul for every three fouls they call on Michigan.\n\nAt the end of the day, if Michigan continues to win at home, I assume Michigan will have the strength of schedule advantage over everyone else.

I don’t think the pistons have ever been ranked first in power rankings since they started putting out nba power rankings. JB deserves to be coach of the year. You guys should be proud of the team and the players. Rotations, injuries, performance issues, trade rumors, etc.\n\nPeople around the league/nation are saying Pistons are currently the best team in the league. Remember when Bojan Bogdanović was our most consistent shooter? Remember when we made Andre Drummond the highest paid player in the league? Remember when Rodney Stuckey was the future? Remember waiting for Stanley Johnson to get his shot? Remember when Jason Maxiel was being called “Baby Ben Wallace.” Remember ",
