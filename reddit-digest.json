But the Eagles traded for Jaelan Phillips and signed Brandon Graham out of retirement. Uche is maybe the 5th DE on the team? He hasn't been *that* great.\n\nFor most declined, PFF lists Reed Blankenship as the 2nd most declined player. But I'm not sure why? He doesn't blow coverages with any high frequency. He tackles fine. Covers fine, though he has been losing his 1v1 coverages more often than past years. But 46.5 is a low grade for someone who I don't think has been that bad. For reference, Adoree Jackson has a 54.6 grade, and Sydney Brown has a 54.8 grade. I swear Jackson and Brown has killed the Eagles far more than Blankenship has this season.\n\nThese grades are weird. No slight to you, OP, as this is really detailed.

        "selftext": "Hello and Happy New Year to r/baseball. It is 2026, pitchers and catchers start reporting in a little over a month, and our hearts collectively gleam with ~~cholesterol buildup~~ hope that this will be the year that greatness happens. By which I of course mean successfully playing an interesting MLB team name in a game of Scrabble\\*.\n\nA few notes that many of you won't read:\n\n* For those of you who may not be familiar with Scrabble (and/or play with so many house rules that you've completely forgotten the actual rules of the game), a play is made by using the 7 tiles in your tile rack to construct a single legal word on the board, where that word must be in a spot where it connects to at least one other word (unless you are going first) and where it does not result in the creation of any illegal words.\n* In deciding whether or not a word is legal, I am using the [official Scrabble dictionary](https://scrabble.merriam.com/). If you want to gripe about whether or not your team's name is allowed, for the love of all that is holy please direct those comments to them and not to me.\n* I will be using the teams' official names as stated on [mlb.com](http://mlb.com/), and no short versions or nicknames, with two caveats. First, where a team name is two words, I am ignoring the spacing if doing so results in an otherwise-playable word, so Toronto fans finally catch a break. Second, I am open to using either the singular or plural of each team name to the extent it might matter.\n* I am only considering plays of the team name, and not situations where the team name might be incidentally formed by playing a different word. This means that we are only considering playing the word \"met\" as such, and not playing something like \"quartz\" off of \"me\" and incidentally forming \"met\" as a consequence.\n* While \"cool\"-ness is inherently subjective, I consider in this calculation the Scrabble score for the team name, the likelihood of getting the 50-point bonus for using all 7 letters, any exotic/high-point letters in the team name, and such other factors as I will describe in probably too much detail below. Listed scores are for the pluralized official team name unless otherwise indicated.\n* As always, these rankings are just for fun, and do not necessarily reflect my feelings vis-a-vis these teams, their players, their ownership, or their fans (unless I explicitly say otherwise).\n\n\\* Scrabble is a registered trademark of Hasbro, Inc. in the U.S. and Canada, but I'm not going to try to type the (R) symbol every time, so Hasbro can just go bite me. \n\n**Tier One: Not Legal Scrabble Words** (but I'll rank 'em anyway)\n\n**30: Houston Astros** (6 points) -- Neither \"[astro](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/astro)\" nor \"[astros](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/astros)\" is recognized as a legal Scrabble word; and moreover it isn't even worth fighting about because it would be such a crappy play.  \n\n**29: Philadelphia Phillies** (13 points) -- None of \"[phil](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/phil),\" \"[philly](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/philly),\" \"[phillie](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/phillie),\" or \"[phillies](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/phillies)\" are legal, to what I hope is no one's surprise. Before anyone asks, I'm not going to consider \"filly.\" And do you really want to be fillies, guys? Young female horses generally considered too young to breed despite being sexually mature? Is that what you REALLY want?\n\n**28: New York Yankees** (14 points) -- Neither \"[yankee](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/yankee)\" nor \"[yankees](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/yankees)\" is playable, which I admit I was moderately surprised to learn. If I relaxed the rules and allowed \"yank,\" that would jump them all the way up to Tier 4, but this isn't Vietnam. This is r/baseball and we have rules. And that rug really tied the room together.\n\n**27: Boston Red Sox** (14 points)\n\n**26: Chicago White Sox** (21 points) -- In what will be fantastic news for Bostonian and Southsider Scrabble enthusiasts, \"sox,\" standing alone, is indeed [Scrabble-legal](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/sox). However, no singular or plural permutation of whitesock/x or redsock/x is similarly playable. Which is really too bad for the White Sox in particular, which otherwise would be a fantastic Scrabble play.\n\n**Tier Two: How My Idiot Sister Plays Scrabble**\n\n**25: Cincinnati Reds** (5 points) -- Literally the lowest-possible Scrabble score for a full team name.\n\n**24: New York Mets** (met) (5 points) -- \"Mets\" is not a legal play, so the score listed is for \"met,\" which is the type of word one plays to communicate that they are not interested in playing Scrabble anymore. \n\n**23: San Francisco Giants** (7 points)\n\n**22: Los Angeles Angels** (7 points) -- Fun fact: I got nearly all the way to the end of these rankings before realizing I had forgotten the Angels. Anyway, the Angels' run of dominance is finally over, which is a funny sentence to type.\n\n**21: Detroit Tigers** (7 points) -- The potentially good news with these three words is that you nearly cleared your rack. The bad news is you wasted a lot of useful letters while only managing to match the score of your 6-year-old child's last play. I can't think of a single objective rationale for putting either the Giants or the Angels ahead of the other, so the Angels win because I'm a Dodgers fan; while the Tigers get an edge over both of them because of the scientific fact that tigers are inherently cool.\n\n**Tier Three: Unremarkable Words that are Nevertheless too Complex for my Idiot Sister**\n\n**20: San Diego Padres** (9 points) -- Yes, \"padres\" is a [playable word](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/padres). English is a linguistic melting pot and all that. Congratulations and enjoy your 9 points.\n\n**19: Kansas City Royals** (9 points) -- Royals get the nod over the Padres for the high-value letter, and (to a much lesser extent) because of the Lorde song. \n\n**Tier Four: Emergency Plays for Emergency Situations**\n\n**18: Tampa Bay Rays** (7 points) -- Sometimes you have to deal with an unforgiving board. \"Rays\" offers nearly as many points as the duo above, but in significantly fewer letters, which means this might be a smart strategic play on some boards (although obviously you would usually prefer to save the S). Plus the Y offers potential for double-letter/triple-letter shenanigans. This is what you should have played instead of \"Royals,\" Lorde be damned.\n\n**17: Minnesota Twins** (8 points) -- Eh. The W is nice enough, but why aren't you playing \"wit\" instead? Or \"nit,\" and save the W for a better opportunity? You're playing like my idiot sister. Whom I should stress does not have a developmental disability or anything like that, and is just a regular idiot.\n\n**16: Chicago Cubs** (8 points) -- Solid bang for your buck here, with C and B worth 3 points each. On a bad board with a tray full of vowels, you could do worse. Like \"met.\" Or \"red.\" Or trying to argue for \"astro.\"\n\n**Tier Five: The Braves Tier**\n\n**15: Atlanta Braves** (11 points) -- A borderline play in a vacuum, but juuuust good enough to keep them out of Tier 3. If anyone is curious, the Scrabble dictionary recognizes \"braves,\" but only in the sense of how someone braves danger. \n\n**Tier Six: The Rockies Tier**\n\n**14: Colorado Rockies** (rocky) (14 points) -- \"Rockies\" is [not playable](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/rockies), but \"rocky\" sure is, for a solid 14 points and the best possible score for a team name that does not offer the possibility of landing that sweet 50-point bonus. Speaking of which ...\n\n**Tier Seven: Seven-Letter Names That are Otherwise Pretty Crappy**\n\n**13: Baltimore Orioles** (7 points) -- In a vacuum \"orioles\" is about as crappy of a Scrabble word as it gets, without a single letter worth more than one point. But for this and all subsequent team names, the 50-point bonus for using all seven letters has now become a possibility. This is why S's are so valuable in Scrabble, since you can just lay out \"orioles\" in its entirety right off the end of your idiot sister's play of \"red,\" creating two crappy words plus that 50-point bonus and causing her to flip the board over and go running to Mom to demand that I stop cheating.\n\n**12: Texas Rangers** (8 points) -- Better get that 50 points, because otherwise what a waste of great letters.\n\n**11: Miami Marlins** (9 points)\n\n**10: Pittsburgh Pirates** (9 points) -- Nothing much interesting to say between these two. Pirates are badass sea criminals and marlins are fairly badass giant sport fish. Slight edge to pirates in the cool department, but if you want to argue the reverse I won't squawk.\n\n**9: Los Angeles Dodgers** (10 points) -- There are only 4 D's in the whole tile bag, and you somehow got two of them at the same time. It's unfair! Baseball is ruined!\n\n**8: Milwaukee Brewers** (12 points) -- If I make MLB team rankings for another 100 offseasons, I will never live down the fiasco of Brewer Hicklen. And also I suppose this would be a reasonably respectable Scrabble play.\n\n**Tier Eight: They Will Talk About This Play For Years**\n\n**7: Seattle Mariners** (10 points) -- The Mariners juuuuust squeak into this tier by virtue of requiring one more letter than you could possibly have on your rack, meaning that you'd have to have at least one letter free on the board to accommodate this play. Luckily almost every letter in \"mariners\" shouldn't be too hard to find on the board, although it is amusing to me to imagine someone with \"mariner\" sitting in their rack waiting for an open S to play it on.\n\n**6: Washington Nationals** (9 points) -- Like the Orioles, the Nationals' team name is about as bad as it gets, consisting entirely of 1-point letters. However, it would still make for a rather cool play, since \"nationals\" is a nine-letter word, which means that you'd have to find a 2-letter word such as \"on\" or \"at\" to build it around, and thereby turn a tray of nothing into a pretty sweet turn -- circumstances unique enough that I'm bumping the Nats one place ahead of the Mariners. At least until your opponent pounces on that open S on their next turn. \n\n**5: Cleveland Guardians** (11 points) -- \"Ar\" and \"an\" are both playable words you could build this off of. And boy oh boy it would be fun to lay this down after mom just helped my idiot sister play \"ar.\" \n\n**4: St. Louis Cardinals** (12 points) -- \"Ar,\" \"in,\" \"na,\" and \"al\" are all potential entry points here, but I'm running out of things to say about 2-letter Scrabble words. How about that Masyn Winn, Cards fans? That kid sure looks great. And also what a great Scrabble name. I mean, he's no Jazz Chisholm, but still...\n\n**Tier Nine: Finally Some Wholly Better Plays** **than \"Rocky\"**\n\n**3: The Philadelphia Athletics of Sacramento** (14 points) -- Ummmm, how about that Masyn Winn, A's fans?\n\n**2: Toronto Blue Jays** (bluejays) (20 points) -- \"Bluejay\" is a FANTASTIC Scrabble word, and also perhaps finally Toronto fans won't yap at me for not allowing \"jay\" on its own. Congratulations, Toronto fans, you've finally done it. Looks like you've got this one all wrapped up. No possible event could foreseeably prevent you from winning this--\n\n**Tier Ten: Why'd it Have to be Snakes?**\n\n**1: Arizona Diamondbacks** (24 points) -- There are those other two D's! Maybe baseball isn't broken after all. What makes \"diamondbacks\" such a cool Scrabble play isn't its length or point total (although those certainly help); it's that the only way you could play it would be if either \"diamond\" or \"backs\" was already on the board. A once-in-lifetime circumstance for a fantastic play.",

        "selftext": "Thomas Frank spoke to the media at Hotspur Way on Friday, ahead of our Premier League clash against Sunderland at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday (3pm UK).\n\nHere's what he had to say...\n\n# Can you go ahead now and announce the Brennan Johnson to Palace news to us exclusively?\n\nThomas: “Nice opening, that's probably something about the rumours but that's the only thing I can say right now.”\n\n# The feeling seems to be that it’s a deal that suits both clubs, suits the player and if it’s going to get done for him to be involved against Newcastle, it pretty much needs to be done…\n\nThomas: “That I know nothing about and basically don't care about. So, like with everything, I'm very happy to speak about everything when everything is announced or published. If that is, we sign a player, we sell a player or a staff member in or out, whatever it is, but for now, yeah, it is what it is.”\n\n# Is he in your squad for the Sunderland game?\n\nThomas: “He was not in the squad yesterday and you will see that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.”\n\n# So, let’s assume we hear later he’s gone to Palace, when you were at Brentford, you tried to sign him, so what's changed?\n\nThomas: “I'll say, I'll repeat my answer as I just said. If that's the case, I would love to answer that question when and if it happens.”\n\n# The away fans were suggesting last night that Spurs are boring, how did that make you feel?\n\nThomas: “I definitely got some reminders about it, including one today. So, thank you for that. I think it's not perfect. We want us to be free-floating. I think a couple of things I want to reinforce positively is the last two away performances. To stand on the foundation we're building was very strong against Palace and Brentford. I think they were very good defensively, in fact fantastic defensively last night, gave them more or less nothing. I think that's hugely important. I think we understood how to close down their transitions. Then we're working very hard and understand the frustrations and share them too. Very hard on the offensive part of the game. There's a few things in that we need to do our best to improve. One of them is, for example, yesterday we lost the ball, unforced errors, 25 times. I showed those 25 clips to the players today. A reminder that's focus, that's concentration, all that. Of course, football is a game of mistakes. You lose the ball, that can happen because of bad decisions, bad touch, whatever, or concentration. So, could just half of them be better? That would provide us more attacks than those definitely maybe five, at least, good counter-attacks where a better touch and we’re suddenly 3v3. Then it looks a little bit more lively, a little bit more open, a little bit better. So, that's the one level we need to do. Then the next bit is the patterns and the structure and getting in the right positions. We didn't get that right last night. I showed that again to the players today. That is my responsibility together with the coaches. I always take that. Then the third thing, I think it's also okay to mention that we still lack some very important offensive players. That been for a while, I don't want to mention it again. We'll get a little bit bored, on top of that, we didn’t have Xavi Simons and Lucas Bergvall. So, the ones on the pitch, always trust them, always believe in them. Wilson is a very promising player I believe a lot in, so lovely against Palace, but it’s natural, a young player, he was a little bit up and down yesterday. I’m convinced he’ll be very good for us. On top of that, you play every third and fourth day. When you do that, the ability, the concentration level and the physical level to be at the top, to keep producing, is what, how can you say, splits the good players from the very best to do that. And sometimes you can be a good player to go to the very best, but you also learn along the way. So, that's where we are right now. It's unfortunately very boring, but that's the facts. We need to do everything we can to put an attacking, intense, front-footed performance out against Sunderland in two days' time. I'll do everything I can to make sure we do that. If we do that and get three points, it’s seven from three, which would be a very good output. So that's the aim. By the way, against the Sunderland team that’s done unbelievably well. And I know for a fact, because, when I say attitude, I'm confident in my own skillset, but also very humble about who I am, where we are and what we need to do. I know what we're facing tomorrow against Sunderland, because I've been there myself. That's going to be tough, I need to be on it. It was a long answer, actually.”\n\n# It's a long answer, but a determined answer – is it also a long answer because you felt hurt?\n\nThomas: “No, it's a long answer because I explained the situation of where we are.”\n\n# To dare is to do – do you need to be more daring?\n\nThomas: “I think I'm very daring. I'm sitting here!”\n\n# Enzo Maresca is the latest managerial casualty – we know you went for an interview – was that a lucky escape?\n\nThomas: “I think we don't know what happened behind the scenes at Chelsea, it's you guys' job to be clever there and then come with your suggestion as to why he's not there anymore. So, yeah, we don't know that. I think that could be a very good reason for it, it could be a bad reason, who knows? And basically I don't care, I have other things to worry about. The one thing I would say is it's difficult to build something sustainable, successful, if you don't keep people in the job for a long time. I've said that many times. All the top examples of clubs being successful year in, year out, they have the head coach, the CEO, the sports directors, the key members, coaching staff and the club for a long time.”\n\n# How do you continue with the defensive solidity that we have seen in the last few games, but then not being afraid, not being hesitant to take the game to some of them?\n\nThomas: “Keep reinforcing the messages, keep trying to do the right thing, keep trying to be brave, try to go forward. I think that's the key thing. And then understand that this Premier League is unbelievably tight. And when it's tight, it's not like it's that easy. But the main thing is that we keep being brave.”\n\n# How difficult is it to do as well as Sunderland have?\n\nThomas: “I think they’ve done fantastically, very, very impressive, the first season in the Premier League. And also, as you say, we're changing a lot of players. They're very clear what they want to do. They understand that when you go out in the Premier League, you need to defend very well. They're very good on set pieces. They fight, they run and now they've got the confidence and done very well against a lot of teams, but also away from home. So, it's going to be a tough test.”\n\n# In terms of team news – with Dominic Solanke, are we looking mid-January, late January?\n\nThomas: “The thing I need to worry about, of course, is when he's out there on the pitch with pictures, that's positive, of course. But to say mid-Jan or end of Jan or 25th of Jan, I will not do that. I will very much look forward to naming the dates when he's involved with the squad. Lucas Bergvall is a doubt, we hope he’ll be ready.”\n\n# How difficult is it for a manager to tell a player that he has to go to a new club – if they don’t want to, different circumstances…\n\nThomas: “There are different scenarios. There are players that want to leave. There are players that are a little bit do they want to stay, do they want to leave, and then there are players that don't want to leave. That's the three different cases you need to solve between sports directors, head coach and player, agent. Hopefully in the most cases everyone is happy in the end of the situation.”\n\n# We spoke a little bit about bench last night - two goalkeepers, not a lot of options. Does that show how difficult it is for you right now and how important this transfer window is?\n\nThomas: “It's my job, my responsibility is to find a solution when there are some tough times. I'll never run away from that. But of course it's easier to have a fully fit squad and you just know you have these five tools. I can do this in the midfield. I can do that on the wing. I can do that on the striker. I can maybe change the full-back or whatever it is. Yes, we were limited last night, but that's part of it, there are some games you will have like that in a season. You need to do those spells, and I think that's another thing, those spells, I know it's not popular to talk about, but those spells, if you then don't lose and you get a point and you're very solid defensively, that's a good thing. That could be a very good point in the end of the season. Do you want to play better? Yes. But that's the unfortunate situation right now.”\n\n# What made you pick two goalkeepers rather than another youngster?\n\nThomas: “That could also have been the case, but it wasn’t last night. “\n\n# On Wilson, so much raw potential, what does he have to work on?\n\nThomas: “I think take the positive away from the Crystal Palace substitution role, where he was so lively and they couldn't catch him. He should have scored. Last night, I think there were still some very positive glimpses. I think he's in the situation where he can make a little bit better decisions, let's say three times a touch, that will just get him in a top position, turns and we’re three-on-three. Instead of, it's a bad touch and then we go the other way, for example. So just keep learning that. That's just a normal part of football. Unfortunately, there's a little bit of extra focus in the Premier League, but hey, that's part of it.”\n\n# Can you be successful at Tottenham without the fans behind you?\n\nThomas: “I will try to maybe turn that question around and say, ‘if you are successful, the Tottenham fans will be behind you’. The fans will get behind us and I'm pretty sure that. Yes, some boos last night, I'm still pretty sure there's a lot of fans behind us.”\n\n# You’ve four points from two away derbies, four points, clean sheets – at the end, they’re booing, chanting ‘boring, boring Tottenham’. Is there a misalignment here with what you see as success in terms of results and the sort of style of football that they need to see but they're not seeing yet?\n\nThomas: “Yeah, I think the expectation is good. I also think we are probably in a bit of a transition. Not that we don't want to play a lot better, but the club, the squad, the injuries, all that, taking into consideration is part of that. In a transition period when not everything is perfect and you don't get the win or we don't play as good as we want or I want, I'm very aware that Palace, I’m happy with that because it's very important to have the ability to do that, but also very aware that we didn't play as good as I want in that aspect, but also I acknowledge where we are, so it's just that understanding of that and that's fair that I understand it a little bit better and the fans want more.”\n\n# I think the fans are struggling with what the plan is for this season and yourself long-term. I know you're talking about competing in all competitions, but what for you would be success this season and what would be success in season two and so on?\n\nThomas: “I think what we are 100% sure will happen is that although we will be able to score a lot of goals, I know we will be much more dominant in a lot of games, but with the current situation with too many of the top players out, playing a lot of games that just make it more tricky, also with no time to train, it's just reality. I think there's not one coach that will not say that. Then we need to manage everything between that, and that's just small steps in the right direction every day. Keep walking forward, keep improving, and then things will take care of itself. Probably answer a few more questions in press conferences like this, improve a little bit, get the wins, and then it will be forgotten because it goes like this. Right now, it's the talk of the town, fair enough. Tomorrow it will be forgotten for a new thing. We just behind the scenes need to be calm, work on the things very hard, and keep improving.”\n\n# Would a top-half finish be success? 12th? Does it have to be Europe?\n\nThomas: “I think for me to name a position where we should end and want to end. I think there are so many things you don't control in that aspect. I promise that we are very ambitious, we know exactly where we want to go, but I think it's about improving next step in front of me, make sure that we come out flying Sunday against Sunderland, look more in sync. Can we see good glimpses of more offensive attacking threat, and get the win? That would be a step forward.”\n\n[Source.](https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2026/january/spurs-vs-sunderland-premier-league-every-word-of-thomas-franks-pre-match-press-conference/)",

        "selftext": "In the Summer there was a lot of talk about how participating in the Club World Cup would affect European teams by disrupting their preseasons (I'm sure there was plenty of similar discussion in other regions, too, but I mainly follow European leagues so that's what I'm focusing on). We're almost halfway through the season, so it's a good time to look how much truth there was to that.\n\nI'm looking at all the 12 UEFA teams that took part in the CWC in the Summer and how their performance compares to the same stage of the previous season. Don't treat too seriously, it's just a bit of fun because there are many factors affecting each team's season.\n\nThe full summary is below but the tl;dr is that there is no clear pattern showing CWC participation adversely affected the European teams in general. The teams that reached semifinals, however, are all performing worse than a year ago.\n\nMain takeaways:\n\n* **5** teams have **fewer points** (Atletico, Benfica, Chelsea, PSG, Madrid) in their domestic leagues than at the same stage last season.\n* **7** teams have **more points** (Bayern, BvB, Inter, Juventus, City, Porto, Salzburg).\n* **3** teams have **sacked coaches** (Benfica, Chelsea, Juventus) with a 4th unlikely to survive January (Madrid)\n* All **3** Europeans clubs that reached the **semis** at the CWC are performing worse than last season (Chelsea, PSG, Madrid)\n* The biggest difference in plus is **City** at **+10** points.\n* The biggest difference in minus is **Chelsea** at **-5** points.\n\n**Atletico**\n\nAfter a dreadful start to the season, they woke up with the magnificent performance in the Madrid derby but even since then it's hardly been smooth sailing. They look well positioned to go through the Champions League first phase comfortably like they did last year but any dreams of the league title are pretty much gone already. Villareal has 2 games in hand, so Atleti might soon drop to 4th.\n\n* 25/26: ⬇️ 3rd (4th), ⬇️ 37p\n* 24/25: 2nd, 41p\n\n**Benfica**\n\n'Undefeated in the league' sounds better than it is. Benfica already sacked a coach this season and with a 10 point gap they don't look capable of threatening Porto's march towards reclaiming the league title. In Champions League they're fighting for survival but with upcoming games against Juventus and Madrid they'd need something special to make the playoffs.\n\n25/26: 🟰 3rd, ⬇️ 36p\n\n24/25: 3rd, 38p\n\n**Bayern**\n\nDespite serious injuries to Musiala and Davies, Bayern are bulldozing Bundesliga. 55 goals in 15 games and Kane scoring for fun. They looked unstoppable in Europe, too, until the Arsenal game. Despite that hiccup, they'll still breeze into the knockout phase and be one of the favourites to win the whole thing.\n\n25/26: 🟰 1st, ⬆️ 41p\n\n24/25: 1st, 34p\n\n**Borussia Dortmund**\n\nWith yet another early cup exit and Bayern far beyond reach in Bundesliga, it's unlikely to be a memorable season for BvB fans but at least they shouldn't have to worry about Champions League qualification. That's a big upgrade over last year. And the team should make Champions League play-offs again so a hope remains for another good run in Europe.\n\n25/26: ⬆️ 2nd, ⬆️ 32p\n\n24/25: 6th, 25p\n\n**Chelsea**\n\nIf I was writing this a month ago, the mood would be much different. Alas, Chelsea spent that month dropping points right left and centre and sacked their manager. The echoes of the victory against Barcelona are long quiet now, as are any murmurs of Chelsea mounting a title challenge. Instead, they'll need to fight for Champions League spots. European campaign is going more or less according to expectations. The Blues can be pretty sure of playoff qualification. Direct path to knockout stage is not out of the question either, but they'd need two victories and a bit of luck. With how recent weeks have gone for them, neither of those are safe bets.\n\n25/26: ⬇️ 5th, ⬇️ 30p\n\n24/25: 4th, 35p\n\n**Inter**\n\nNerazzurri are an odd team this season. Sitting on top of Serie A and in a qualifying spot for the Champions League knockouts (albeit with very tough games against Arsenal and Dortmund, they'll have a big task defending that position), you'd think things are looking good. But every time it seemed like they've hit their stride, a game against a high-rated team comes and Inter loses. This season they were already defeated by Juventus, Milan, Napoli, Liverpool, and Atletico. Repeating the spectacular European runs of recent years looks like a tall order but they are favourites to win the league.\n\n25/26: ⬆️ 1st, ⬆️ 36p\n\n24/25: 3rd, 34p\n\n**Juventus**\n\nLast season was a write-off and this one didn't start promising, either. Tudor quickly got the sack but Spalletti managed to stop the bleeding - the results have improved, even if style remains questionable. As things stand, Juve are headed for the Champions League playoffs and a heated TOP 4 battle in Serie A. Crazy things are happening at the top of the table in Italy in this campaign, so you shouldn't rule out Spall dragging Juve back into the title race.\n\n25/26: ⬆️ 5th, ⬆️ 32p\n\n24/25: 6th, 31p\n\n**Man City**\n\nBy the standards City have established for themselves, previous season was a calamity. The beginning of this campaign was rocky as well but Pep has eventually managed to steady the ship and Cherki and Reijnders look like they're starting to gel with the team.  While they're still far off the heights of their treble-winning season, City are back as a force to be reckoned with. They're sitting on Arsenal's tail in the league and should make TOP 8 in Champions League with ease.\n\n25/26: ⬆️ 2nd, ⬆️ 41p\n\n24/25: 6th, 31p\n\n**Porto**\n\nCruising in the league, with only 2 points dropped and 4 goals conceded in 16 games. 8th in Europa but with games against Plzen and Rangers it's easy to imagine Porto climbing up a couple of spots before the end of the league phase.\n\n25/26: ⬆️ 1st, ⬆️ 46p\n\n24/25: 2nd, 40p\n\n**PSG**\n\nPlagued with injuries, Paris have been a disappointment domestically so far, ending the year in second place. Despite the fitness issues, the European campaign is looking decent. They should smoothly advance into Champions League knockouts and if they manage to keep the squad healthy in the second half of the season, we all know what they're capable of.\n\n25/26: ⬇️ 2nd, ⬇️ 36p\n\n24/25: 1st, 40p\n\n**Real Madrid**\n\nAfter a promising start, everything seems to have fallen apart. A couple of injuries, reports of internal strife, and unconvincing results against top opposition and now Xabi Alonso is fighting for survival with slim prospects of success. They're only 4 points behind Barcelona so the ball is very much still in play but with Madrid fading and Barca gaining steam, Los Blancos will be the underdog in this fight. In Europe they should secure a place in the knockouts despite defeats to City and Liverpool and anything can happen in the Champions League as long as Madrid are involved. Hard to say who will be coaching them in the second half of the season though.\n\n25/26: ⬇️ 2nd, ⬇️ 42p\n\n24/25: 1st, 43p\n\n**Red Bull Salzburg**\n\nSalzburg had a disappointing last season and at least domestically there are signs that they're back on track this year. That said, both them and defending champions from Graz have been dropping plenty of points lately so the title race remains wide open. They're about to crash out of Europa League after a poor showing.\n\n25/26: ⬆️ 1st, ⬆️ 32p\n\n24/25: 5th 27p",

There are no signs of Ausar becoming a better shooter. He will not even shoot open 3s which kills our spacing. I do not think we can really afford having two nonshooters share the floor. \n\nObtaining a scoring threat next to Cade makes us legit contenders. We would also see Cade's shot selection improve and efficiency rise because he will not be triple teamed anymore. Pacers were able to take the next step by trading for Siakam. I think we will have to do something similar eventually. \n",
