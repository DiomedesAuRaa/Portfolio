It might even kill the visiting team, granted the \"home\" team had the good sense to actually stay home that day.\n\nSome better analogies for a poor defender include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. An unobstructed ureter.\n2. A disenchanted high school teacher who has given up on trying to make a difference.\n3. A broken airport metal detector.\n4. Someone who doesn't understand jokes.\n5. A traffic light where all three lights are green.\n6. A poorly positioned diaphragm.\n7. A priority target for a squad of storm-troopers.\n8. A trust-based low security Danish prison.\n9. A worry-free millennial.\n10. An overactive and scientifically anomalous immune system.\n11. An inanimate carbon rod.\n12. Crotchless boxers.\n13. A Watchmojo top 10 list.\n14. People who use the term 'acronym' when it is clearly an initialism.\n15. James Harden.\n16. An understudy fluffer who's been suddenly called into active duty.\n17. Someone who always misses their flight.\n18. Flattened villi from undiagnosed celiac disease.\n19. A Ben Shapiro video essay.\n20. Someone who had love, but didn't realize it until it was too late.\n21. Someone who doesn't know what to do with their hands when having a casual in-person conversation with someone they just met at a work-mandated social gathering.\n\nSo in closing, please be more careful with your analogies, and the next time someone calls YOU a black hole on defense, take it as a compliment and offer to expertly secure their balls like every black hole would.",

        "selftext": "Explanations for the first few picks:\n\n17) Kadyn Proctor, OT\n\nProctor is a physical demon who isn't 100% refined but could ideally redshirt partially under Taylor Decker and build up a bit more technique. With some development he could genuinely become the next Mailata. If Decker retires this offseason, Proctor could still serve as a plug-and-play starter, especially since he's experienced protecting the blind side. In any case, I think the Lions draft the best OT available here, and maybe even trade up a pick or two for Fano or Mauigoa if they're available at spot 15-17.\n\n50) Connor Lew, C\n\nI have a sneaking suspicion that the Lions will either sign a major center or EDGE rusher in the offseason. And since teams are more reluctant to let their OL players go, I'm projecting they maybe sign Bosa or Hendrickson (if they want to splurge) and then draft a dedicated player at center. Lew is likely the best C in the draft and his presence would allow Tate Ratledge to remain RG where he's most comfortable.\n\n118) Jacob Rodriguez, LB\n\nRodriguez has had a massive hype jump this year, showing great versatility and intelligence as a LB. With Anzalone likely leaving this offseason, despite a pretty deep LB room, the Lions could benefit from another major playmaker alongside Jack Campbell. Honestly, I'd be surprised if he fell this far but would be elated if we could scoop him up here.\n\n134) Anthony Lucas, EDGE\n\nEven when healthy, the Lions' defense has struggled with pass rush all season, with a revolving door of practice squad players opposite Hutchinson. Lucas will hopefully remedy this inconsistency, with a big build that appeals to the Lions' defensive scheme and great physical traits. Plus, he's injury prone, so Brad Holmes will love him!\n\n156) Xavier Scott, S\n\nWith Branch likely out for the majority of next season and Joseph with a lingering bum knee, the Lions' secondary will be rough next year. While a fifth-rounder isn't going to remedy that on his own, Scott is a pretty versatile DB with experience both in the slot and as a safety. Depending on personnel strengths and which FAs the team decides to resign, Scott could fill a couple of roles on the back end.\n\nLet me know what picks you'd like the team to make next year!",

        "selftext": "They had us projected to win ~44 games and to be the 12th best team in the league (~54% win percentage). Currently we are 24-6, with a win percentage of 80%, as the first seed in the east. Even after last seasons trajectory, we were extremely underrated by legacy media to a hilarious extent.\n\nIn the east they had these 4 teams ahead of us:\n\n**Hawks**, who finished last year with a worse record, who are currently 15-16, playing under .500 basketball and in the play in. Obviously Young playing in a third of their games hurts their record which couldn't have been predicted. Luckily they have had a breakout year by Jalen Johnson. ESPN citing \"major\" additions such as\n* Porzingis who is great while healthy, has had trouble staying on the court even before his long haul covid issues. He's played in less than half their games this year.\n* Kennard who is a fantastic three point shooter who detroit has history with, and in my opinion doesn't pass the eye test. Advanced stats show he has negative value offensively and defensively, and has zero value over his replacement.\n\n**Magic**, who finished last year with a worse record, who are currently 17-13 and are the 6th seed. ESPN predicted them to be in the top 3, even with their health issues last year, and starting off this year with yet another injury to one of their starters, Suggs. Their major addition was trading the farm for our favorite T-rex armed guy, Bane. This doesn't seem to have worked out for them. He apparently forgot everything he improved on in the last 4 years. Rebounds, assists, and steals are down from last year, while his PPG remained about the same. However his 3p% went from 39.2% to 36.6%, his FG% from 48.4% to 45%, and his eFG% cratered from 56.5% to 51.1%. Advanced stats don't do him any favors either. While his past 4 years of Offensive BPM were 2.5, 3.3, 3.1, 2.6, his current 0.4 is abysmal compared to those. He's also a slightly negative defender with -0.2 Defensive BPM, and his Value over replacement is 0.5 compared to 2.9 last year. Paolo went from game winning ~~travels~~ double step backs against us to being a 46.6 eFG% player. It's so bad I had to look where that ranks in the NBA. 405th worst. Ouch. Eye test against us was him trying to play hero ball, icing out the actual best player on their team, Franz. He's playing great.\n\n**Knicks**. ESPN predicted them to finish in the top 3. Currently the 2 seed at 20-9. Not much to say about them, they are largely the same team they were last year. I did enjoy seeing Brunson eat a chest pass from Lamelo from about 2 feet away this year, with Brunson doing an actual head snap-back that we saw all playoffs when any contact was made with with non-head regions of his body.\n\nCavs. ESPN predicted them to finish in the top 3. Currently in the play-in at 17-14. They would have to go 47-4 over their remaining games to match last years record. Obviously Bickerstaff coaching was an issue. Just ignore what Detroit has done since hiring him. Lonzo Ball signing didn't move any needles as he's playing terribly. Garland who I feel was underappreciated in their success last year is shooting an abysmal 47.9 eFG% and has only played in half their games due to injury. Mitchell is having a crazy high offensive stat year, but it's not translating to wins. ESPNs referenced defensive Duo of Allen and Mobley looks about the same as last year, but advanced stats on offense and defense are majorly down for some reason. I'm sure it has nothing to do with playing less with their PG Garland, and more time with their SG Mitchell running the offense to seemingly only his benefit.\n\nEdit: Link to article. https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46617842/2025-26-nba-season-preview-rankings-predictions-odds-more",
