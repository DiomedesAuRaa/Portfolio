        "selftext": ">  The club to the Real Madrid fan section ahead of tomorrow's match, right? \n\n>Yes, to the fan section, which is the fan section at the south end of the Santiago Bernabéu. The fan section leaders have informed all members who occupy that area that tomorrow the club is asking them not to boo the Real Madrid players, not to join the rest of the stadium when the players are booed. \n\n> Not only should they not boo, but they should applaud and cheer on the players. The leaders of the fan section, who, let us remember, are in direct contact with the club, suggest to their members that anyone who wants to show their anger should do so outside the stadium, outside the Bernabéu, and that anyone who wants to do so inside has time to give up their season ticket to avoid a problem. \n\n> There will also be control over the flags and messages displayed in the background. Grada Fans warns its members that flags from the different fan clubs located in that area will not be used, only their own, more generic Grada Fans flags, which will be handed out at the entrance to the match.\n\n> It is important to note that there are security cameras in that area that the club monitors. Grada Fans knows that anyone who breaks these rules tomorrow is taking a risk; in other words, if you boo, you may not be allowed back. There are 1,800 fans who occupy this privileged position for around €500 per year, and we are aware that in recent hours there has been debate and anticipation in the WhatsApp groups of fans in that area, the South Stand of the Santiago Bernabéu, about what will happen tomorrow.",

The Algerian striker, currently 37 years old and playing for the Romanian team Cluj, explains that the focus was so much on working and improving, then under the command of Leonardo Jardim, that he neglected his diet...\n\n\"I was starving when I arrived at Sporting. My life was like this: I'd go to training, come home and eat a pizza – one of those frozen ones... I swear it's true. Frozen pizza at midday; and I also ate noodles, the kind that come in a packet and you boil them. I ate that every day, plus tuna and margarine... I'd take a nap, have a coffee, and what I hadn't eaten in the morning, I'd eat at night or the next day. I did that for a year. I didn't go to a restaurant once. I swear, and I didn't know how to cook...\", the striker explained in an interview given to journalist Colin Dicanot's channel.\n\nAnd he finished, amidst... much laughter from both of them: \"You know the worst part? They provided lunch at the Academy, but I didn't know. I was so focused that I didn't even know and went straight home \\[after training\\]. And nobody asked me why I wasn't going to eat...\"\n\nWith the Lion on his chest, Slimani completed 123 games (plus one in the B team), in which he scored 61 goals and registered nine assists. In 2013, the SAD paid 300,000 euros to CR Belouizdad, an Algerian club, for his transfer.",

        "selftext": "First off - I want to say - this is not an anti Goff post. Nor is it a pro Goff post. This is a post to describe the season in a tangible way.\n\nMy posts about Gibbs and Montgomery seemed to have some good traction, so I figure I'll do on on Goff. We'll go through this data in a few sections. First lets review the 2024 season vs the 2025 season. Below you'll find  table with various comparisons.\n\nThe narrative around Goff this year has been confusing. Was he efficient? Did he regress? Did MCDC \"fix\" the offense or break it? I pulled the play-by-play data for the full 2024 and 2025 seasons to find out.\n\n|**Period**|**Games**|**EPA/Play**|**Success Rate**|**CPOE**|**Comp %**|**Int Rate**|**Sack Rate**|**Pass Yds/G**|**Air Yards**|**3rd Down Succ**|**RZ TD Rate**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**2024 Season**|17|0.28|54.3%|5.7|72.6%|2.1%|5.3%|263.0|6.4|48.0%|22.0%|\n|**2025 Season**|17|0.18|48.6%|1.8|68.2%|1.3%|6.1%|256.0|6.5|38.6%|25.3%|\n\nThe year-over-year comparison shows a qb who took fewer risks but lost his elite efficiency. While he cut down on interceptions, his ability to sustain drives (3rd Down Success) and execute at a high level (EPA/Play) took a major hit.\n\n* **Explosives & Efficiency Drop:** Goff's EPA/Play dropped significantly (0.28 to 0.18), and his consistency (Success Rate) fell by nearly 6%.\n* **Issues on 3rd Down:** The biggest regression was on 3rd Down. In 2024, he converted nearly half the time (48.0%); in 2025, that fell to 38.6%, leading to more stalled drives.\n* **Risk Aversion:** The silver lining is that he played \"safer.\" His interception rate nearly halved (2.1% to 1.3%), and his Red Zone TD rate actually improved (25.3%).\n\nAll in all, Goff had a very good 2025 season. However we can say with certainty that his stats dropped from MVP worthy to simply above average. We all know what the root cause is - offensive line - or at the very least, the offensive line played a large role in this regression. However, this post is not meant to be an offensive line post. We can try to dig into that another day.\n\n**Let's now look at the 2025 splits (Morton V Campbell).**\n\n|**Period**|Yards/Game|**EPA/Play**|**Success Rate**|**CPOE**|**Comp %**|**Int Rate**|**YAC Avg**|**3rd Down EPA**|**3rd Down Succ**|**RZ TD Rate**|**Avg Def Rank**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Weeks 1-9 (Morton)**|228.2|0.20|51.1%|\\+7.7|73.8%|1.1%|6.0|\\-0.14|35.8%|32.4%|15.7|\n|**Weeks 10-18 (Campbell)**|280.8|0.16|46.8%|\\-2.6|64.3%|1.4%|6.3|0.20|41.2%|21.0%|18.3|\n\nMan, this is striking. There are **large differences** during the year. Some things got better, some things got worse:\n\n* **Accuracy:** The most shocking stat is CPOE (Completion Percentage Over Expected). Under Morton, Goff was elite (**+7.7**). Under Campbell, he was actually *below* league average (**-2.6**). He went from making difficult throws to missing routine ones.\n* **Empty Yards:** Goff averaged **50+ more passing yards per game** under Campbell (280.8 vs 228.2), but his explosives (EPA) dropped. This suggests the offense was racking up yards between the 20s but failing to be efficient on a down-by-down basis. This is backed up by the decrease in success rate (51.1% to 46.8%)\n* **The 3rd Down Trade-off:** Campbell *did* fix the 3rd down issue (improving success rate from 35.8% to 41.2%), but it came at the cost of Red Zone execution, which tanked from **32.4%** to **21.0%**.\n* **Strength of Schedule Impact:** The data shows that we actually played worse defenses under Campbell as a play caller. I wasn't sure about this, so wanted to add it to the dataset.\n\nI wanted to see how Goff's tendencies changed after the play caller change. To do this I looked at who Goff was throwing to (by position) and how that impacted expected points added.\n\n|**Period**|**RB Catches**|**RB EPA/Catch**|**TE Catches**|**TE EPA/Catch**|**WR Catches**|**WR EPA/Catch**|WR  ADOT|RB  ADOT|TE DOT|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Weeks 1-9 (Morton)**|42|0.19|**43**|1.06|92|1.13|7.5|\\-1.1|5.0|\n|**Weeks 10-18 (Campbell)**|**59**|0.49|23|0.38|**134**|1.29|8.7|0.7|3.5|\n\nThere was a drastic change in who was targeted and who made catches in based on who the playcaller was.\n\n* **Increased WR usage:** The offense shifted entirely to the perimeter. WR catches exploded (92 to 134), and they were asked to run deeper routes (ADOT increased from 7.5 to 8.7). Without looking up the data, we know that Jameson Williams saw gigantic increases in production when MCDC took over. EPA/Play as whole for receivers went up a bit under Campbell as well.\n* **Tight End Became a black hole:** Under Morton, the TE was a focal point (43 catches, massive 1.06 EPA). Under Campbell, TE usage was cut in half (23 catches), and their efficiency tanked (0.38 EPA). **I'm just pointing out these figures, but we all know this is because LaPorta got injured**.\n* **The RB Valve:** As noted in my previous analysis, the RB became the primary check-down option, seeing a significant jump in volume (59 catches) - but ADOT on running back passes went up! So these weren't *just* screens and checkdowns. There are some actual passes sprinkled in.\n\nThere is a theme here - Explosiveness went up under Campbell, Efficiency went down.\n\nLast, lets see how Goff faired against various defenses in 2025 as a whole.\n\n|**Defensive Tier**|**Games**|**EPA/Play**|**Success Rate**|**Int Rate**|**Comp %**|**Pass Yds/G**|**TD:INT**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Bottom 10 Defense**|4|0.31|55.8%|0.7%|74.6%|280.0|9:1|\n|**Mid-Tier Defense**|8|0.24|52.5%|1.0%|72.0%|262.0|16:3|\n|**Top 10 Defense**|5|\\-0.03|37.0%|2.2%|57.3%|228.0|9:4|\n\nThe direction of this makes complete sense. Against better defenses, Goff played worse (DUHHH!!), but it's a pretty dramatic difference! EPA/Play went from 0.31/play to -0.03 when comparing bottom feeding teams vs elite defenses. I feel like we saw a lot of this - we were able to beat the bad teams but we really struggled against teams that were good.\n\n**TL;DR:** Goff played \"safer\" in 2025 but lost the elite efficiency of 2024. The switch to Campbell's play-calling increased passing volume and fixed 3rd down struggles, but it cratered Goff's accuracy, and ruined efficiency—all while facing statistically slightly easier defenses.\n\n**EDIT: I was asked about breaking out the season in quarters. Here are the results.**\n\n|**Period**|**Games**|**EPA/Play**|**Success Rate**|**CPOE**|**Comp %**|**Int Rate**|**Sack Rate**|**Pass Yds/G**|**Air Yards**|**YAC Avg**|**3rd Down EPA**|**3rd Down Succ**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Games 1-4**|4|0.30|52.3%|10.0|73.8%|1.6%|3.1%|229.0|7.9|4.8|0.03|39.5%|\n|**Games 5-8**|4|0.11|50.0%|5.4|73.7%|0.7%|10.4%|228.0|5.2|7.2|\\-0.33|31.6%|\n|**Games 9-12**|4|0.11|48.3%|\\-5.0|64.0%|1.4%|5.5%|269.0|5.9|7.6|0.10|44.1%|\n|**Games 13-17**|5|0.19|45.8%|\\-0.9|64.5%|1.4%|5.7%|290.0|6.7|5.4|0.26|39.2%|\n\nThe results are interesting. There was a decline from the first 4 games to the next 4, but it was only slight. I'd attribute it to noise. The dramatic differences start when Campbell took over play calling. Looks like things really tailed off in the last 5 games of the season.\n\n**EDIT 2: I was also asked to see comparisons with other QBs. Here is the list of comparisons.** For the full year, Goff was near the top in terms of EPA per Play. He was 8th in 3rd down success rate, 8 in interception rate, and 8th in Red zone EPA.\n\n|**Rank (EPA)**|**Name**|**Team**|**Dropbacks**|**EPA/Play**|**Rank (Int)**|**Int Rate**|**Rank (3rd Down)**|**3rd Down Succ**|**Rank (RZ)**|**RZ EPA**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**1**|D.

        "selftext": "If you want Detroit to swing a big trade for a legit secondary scorer next to Cade, it’s probably not coming from some combo of Harris/Ivey/LeVert.\n\nI’m not saying blow up the core... I don’t want that either. But this isn’t 2K.\n\nDetroit probably isn’t landing a goto perimeter scorer through free agency, and they aren’t getting one by stapling together role players and late first round picks. If you seriously want someone who slots in as a reliable No. 2 option next to Cade, it’s going to take selling high on someone with real league-wide value.\n\nAusur comes to mind. He’s already one of the most versatile defenders in the league, and he’s a big reason this team is competitive.\n\nIt’s also obvious we need more consistent perimeter scoring to give Cade and Duren room to operate, and maybe that makes Ausur a luxury.\n\nHonestly, if you make a Venn diagram of what Beef Stew and Holland bring (pros & cons) that overlap starts to look a little like Ausar: hustle defender, active hands, positional flexibility, athleticism… but very limited offense outside the break.\n\nThe clock is ticking too. Cade’s already on the max. Duren’s next deal could get expensive fast. If Ausar keeps trending up, he’s going to cost too. Once those deals stack up, there will have to be sacrifices somewhere.\n\n(EDIT: I should note again that I am not saying that we blow up the core. I just think a lot of the expectations on getting a Pippen on this team for Tobias's expiring, Ivey and some picks is absurd. I'd rather we make some moves around the edges until the salary cap forces the team to make bigger moves. But if you wanted to make a big move, Ausur is how to get it done, that's all.)",
