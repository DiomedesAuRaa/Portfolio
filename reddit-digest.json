        "selftext": "I saw a clip of Nick Wright on X talking about how Pro Bowl voting needs to be overhauled because of examples like this. For first-round picks, the fifth-year option amount isn’t fixed just by draft slot anymore. Instead, it has four tiers:\n\nBasic Tier: lowest salary, based mostly on positional averages.\n\nPlaytime Tier: higher than basic, based on playing time thresholds.\n\nOne Pro Bowl Tier: earns a salary equal to the transition tag at his position.\n\nMultiple Pro Bowls Tier: earns a salary equal to the franchise tag at his position. \n\nFWIW, alternate Pro Bowl selections do not count towards this. So Drake Maye for example, who was like the 8th backup Pro Bowler last year but a legit Pro Bowler this year, only has one pro Bowl counting towards his 5th year option raise.",
