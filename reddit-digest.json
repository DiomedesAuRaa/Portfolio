If he does nothing then teams will just get away with it, but turning into a flopper is a horrible alternative too.\n\nNBA needs to address this phenomenon because it's not good for the game. If certain big men mean the rules no longer apply for defenses, it will only encourage more flopping. It's a lose lose\n\nEdit: wanna add that I am not the type of fan who condemns any player for flopping. I have a \"don't hate the player, hate the game\" mentality. It's a league issue. I think players can flop for different reasons but ultimately is a bad product that no one wants to see. However, the league rewards the behavior so I am not gonna hate on any individual for simply trying to take advantage of the exploits and be competitive within the given circumstances and set of rules.",

Additionally, the Kings just traded Dennis Schroeder (for DeAndre Hunter, who is hurt), so they basically had no rotation point guards active tonight.\n\nAt the end of the game, though, the Kings ran the best lineup they had, keeping Lavine and DeRozan as well as their other starters on the floor. But Wizards Head Coach Brian \"Chief\" Keefe was determined to lose; we trotted out one of the worst lineups in the league all season and the Kings still couldn't pull it out. Most of the 4th, we were running the following lineup:\n\n* AJ Johnson (1.7 PPG)\n* Anthony Gill (1.8 PPG, genuinely our Udonis Haslem)\n* Will Riley (21st overall pick this year, 5.6 PPG)\n* Sharife Cooper (0.8 (!!!) PPG)\n\nand finally, **Skal Labissiere**. For additional reference, Skal is a 10 year vet who's been in the G-League since 2020. In his first game after we called him up, against Portland, he played 3 minutes. Tonight he played 26.\n\nWe were so unbelievably committed to losing this game and just couldn't. GG Kings",

He saw my jersey and told me that Carter would be here signing autographs later. \n\n\nCame back later and got in line. Nobody knew about this signing because there were 6 other people ahead of me. Across the street, you can see hundreds of Jays fans walking to the game, oblivious that Carter was 50 feet away and signing autographs at a free event.\n\n\nSince it wasn't that busy, he spent more time with everyone and was just one of the friendliest guys. Had him sign my jersey (that is now in a jersey case) and he signed a few of the baseball cards they had to giveaway. One of my favourite interactions with anyone that gave me one of my favorite signed pieces. I will definitely be there to see that statue unveil to support that man.\n\n\nFan for life.\n\n\nEdit.
