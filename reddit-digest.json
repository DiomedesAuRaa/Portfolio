Come playoff time we will need a secondary shot creator and hopefully one who can make high volume 3s…Not a better time than now to strike while the East is weak with Haliburton, Tatum and essentially Giannis out of the way. \n\nHold the fort and love this team as constructed, yes, however don’t be crushed and whining when Cade is constantly overwhelmed and we rely solely on Duncan Robinson to bail us out from our shooting woes. Trajan saw last postseason where Beasley became obsolete and Cade was pressured immensely, he will add the piece or pieces needed to give us an actual shot at winning the championship, which is an actual reality but not as constructed….wait until next season when Green, Reed dip to get some more deserved money and all of a sudden this team isn’t as deep. We can win this year if we play our cards right, I say go for it because the cost isn’t actually that much to make it happen. We have 14.1 in trade exception and all our firsts and a dozen 2 rounders to make this a reality.",
