        "selftext": "I've been into F1 since the early 90s as a kid, and up until recently I never met *anyone* in the UK who liked the sport. Various people who'd casually watch a race, but no one was into it. Even did marshalling at a British race track for a bit (Oulton Park) and all the other marshals said they never bothered do the F1 at Silverstone because it was \"boring\". \n\nMost people seemed to think the same - races too long (despite most not being much longer than a football match if you account for half-time), annoying sound, no real action, etc. I've no idea how the British GP sold out every year or where they all came from!\n\nWhen F1 finally exploded in popularity over the past several years, it was basically a life-long dream come true. Finally other people who liked it, it being discussed in other media, even in my work (dance music industry) DJs often play F1 events now and while I've not managed it yet, I am hoping to be able to get to a race with a DJ through work. I remember when the only entertainment at the British Grand Prix for example was just Eddie Jordan's band, god rest him.\n\nThere's a slight downside in that there's an increase in \"football fans\" which studies have shown does involve a similar part of the brain to religion, and they simply *cannot* accept that \"their\" driver/team is in the wrong if an incident occurs. It's childish and offputting, but no big deal, easy to ignore, and it's a small price to pay for a hugely increased popularity as most new fans are brilliant and it's great to have people to just share the interest with. I also maybe don't really get that aspect of hardcore fandom as I've never been into one driver or team, I just like the sport in general.\n\nI'd even, tentatively, say that the change in engine noise is a huge help. F1 on in the background in a pub or bar say, is now just like any other sport, not an intensely annoying noise for people who don't like engines and fast cars. I personally massively miss the old sound, but I *get* why the new reduced sound works. And it's still there a bit, it's just more tolerable to a wider number of people.\n\nSo fellow veterans, what are your thoughts on this? And newcomers, how do you perceive the attitude of older F1 fans in general? Welcoming, or hostile? ",

        "selftext": "... “Jernaro has proved to be one of the top secondary coaches in the country,” (DC Jay) Hill said. “Last year, he helped us (develop into) one of the best pass defenses in the nation and lead the country in interceptions. He deserves everything in coaching that comes to him. I love having him on our staff. Jernaro makes our team better every day.”\n\n... “BYU is so blessed to have a man like G. who has been there for nine years,” Daniel said. “He should be there for the next 20.”\n\n... “G is the most valuable (assistant) coach at BYU, and it is not close,” Daniel told the Deseret News last month before graduation. “If you want to make some people angry, put that (comment) in the paper. If you want to talk about value, it is not close. That man is so, so valuable to BYU.\n\n“The way he recruits, the way players look up to him, the way they think about him, is (legitimate),” Daniel continued. “Look at the way they respect his word, the way he cares about them. The way he takes time to have those little conversations with them.”\n\n... “With (Gilford), it isn’t always about football. It is the way he talks to them about school, about what the guys are doing off the field. He invites guys over to his house to eat all the time. He is the most valuable guy in the building, and it ain’t close.”\n\n... “The way he treated me when I came in was tremendous,” Daniel said. “You want to talk about a man with no ego, a man who knows what it takes to build a program and know what it is all about, that’s Jernaro. … I came in as a guy who had just retired from playing. He could have said, ‘Just sit there, don’t say much.’ Not Jernaro. He’s not afraid of this or that, of losing his job.”\n",

Add in that after Sewell, Brad essentially hoped that mid to late round projects like Manu and Mahogany would be able to become reliable starters, and you can see how the line fell apart fast.\n\n\nThe biggest crime was not making a move for Frank’s successor sooner, and no, I don’t buy drafting a life-long guard in Tate with the plan to move him to center. Frank talked retirement for years, and I get he announced it after the draft, but even Penei on St Brown’s podcast that everyone knew he was done after the Commander’s game. If the players knew, Brad and Dan knew as well or they are inept as hell. \n\n\nGoing into the year with the plan for Graham as your starting center was always a disaster.

They have the 72nd most talented roster in the country and they are now 14-0 and #1 in the country. Yes, theres NIL/portal but its not like they’re bringing in 5 star guys. Its mostly players who were with Cignetti at JMU and overlooked 3 star guys. \n\nIts Moneyball on steroids. And lots of good coaching. \n\nEven if they lose, its already impressive. But if they win it all, its some Norman Dale legendary shit. ",

        "selftext": "I’m sure the NBA isn’t going to miss me, but I’m tired of paying attention to a league that has no regard for their fans. In the Warriors vs. Thunder game last night (1/2/2026), Steph, Draymond, and Jimmy Butler all sat on the bench. These are the most expensive tickets in the league; no doubt these particular tickets were listed at a higher price because of dynamic pricing. \n\nI’ve been a fan for years of the NBA,\nListened to multiple weekly podcasts across The Ringer/Grantland/ESPN and I’ve refused to buy tickets over the years because of high probability a star or stars would be sitting. This should be a civil lawsuit for the fans who constantly get mistreated by a monopolistic enterprise and have no recourse to choose another product. It’s a travesty and why I hope no other leagues take on tanking or load management practices. F*** the NBA.\n\n***Addition to the post***\nI want to be clear, my issue isn’t with the Players. This is an ownership/Front Office issue. A lot of these load management games are determined well in advance with the training staffs/medical teams. This is a problem the owners/Adam Silver could solve, and as fans we’ve let them off the hook for their greed. It’s a horrible situation for fans and I feel bad for kids who looked forward to seeing Steph for the first time and didn’t see him. It’s greedy, and it’s wrong. ",
