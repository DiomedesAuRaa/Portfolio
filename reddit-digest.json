        "title": "Why Indiana actually went 3-9, NOT 16-0.",

        "selftext": "So as we all know, the Indiana Hoosiers just went 16-0 to win their first national title in school history. However, in this post I'll break down why that is actually impossible and they actually went 3-9.\n\n1. Indiana's first 3 games were against FCS teams. So let's say they didn't play any of them, and instead played actually COMPETETIVE teams. Well, who knows what would have happened? So, we can automatically mark those down as losses.\n2. Their Big 10 Opener was against Illinois, who put up an atrocious performance against them, losing 63-10. However, we can ALSO pencil that one down as a loss. Why? Because the next week, Fernando Mendoza lead a game winning drive against Iowa, and won 20-15. We all know game winning drives are pure luck, not skill, so that is technically a loss. But as a Nebraska fan, I refuse to give Iowa a win in this situation, so instead I will give it to Illinois.\n3. Indiana is now 1-4 walking into Eugene against Oregon, where they win 30-20. However, that one is also a loss because Oregon was ranked #3 at the time, so for Indiana to win that, that would mean they were at minimum a #2 team that night. #2 teams have national championship hopes, however 4 loss teams don't. So it just wouldn't make sense for Indiana to win that one. 1-5.\n4. Then they play Michigan State, who put up the second best performance against Indiana as an unranked team. But, actually it's the best performance they put up, because we already marked Iowa as a loss, remember? And if your a team putting up the best performance against someone who's 1-5 as an unranked team, that pretty much means a win right? So now, Indiana is 1-6.\n5. Then they blew out UCLA 56-6, but that wouldn't really make a whole lotta sense, because UCLA was on a 3 game win streak, just having upset #2 Penn State. Therefore, it wouldn't be logical for UCLA to end all that momentum against a 1-6 team. Indiana's 1-7.\n6. Then the very next week, they play @ Maryland who they blew out 55-10. That's only because Indiana was motivated and had a lot of momentum with their fraudulent wins, you can only imagine they wouldn't have that much motivation as a 1-7 team. So we can count that as a one possession win for Indiana. BUT, since it was AT Maryland, Maryland got that home field advantage, so that means a loss for the Hoosiers.\n7. Then Indiana played Penn State which they won out of pure luck. This is because that crazy catch on that game winning drive was improbable, because what if there was just a slight gust of wind, and blew the receiver just a few inches to the side? Wouldn't had been a catch, and instead out of bounds, so Indiana would have lost. 1-9.\n8. The next 2 games we can count as wins, because as a Nebraska fan I can't give Wisconsin a win, and according to my perfect algorithm, Purdue was the worst team in the Big 10 and Indiana was the 2nd worst team, so Purdue would have lost.\n9. A 3-9 team obviously can't make the conference championship or the playoffs, so all those extra wins disappear.\n\nAnd there you have it folks, the perfect and most logical explanation for how Indiana's season should have went.",

        "selftext": "Ex-Fifa boss shows support for boycott calls\n\nSecurity concerns over tournament have risen\n\nFormer Fifa president Sepp Blatter on Monday suggested he supports fans boycotting World Cup matches in the United States this year due to security concerns.\n\nBlatter gave his support to comments from Swiss anti-corruption lawyer Mark Pieth, who worked with Fifa on potential reforms when Blatter was president, saying fans should stay away from the US for the tournament.\n\n“I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup,” Blatter said on social media.\n\nPieth cited the killing of protester Renee Good by an American immigration agent in Minneapolis earlier this month as one reason for supporters not to travel to the US. Blatter’s endorsement of Pieth’s comments comes in the wake of the death of a second US citizen, Alex Pretti, last weekend.\n\nThe World Cup is due to be hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico from 11 June to 19 July.\n\n“What we are seeing domestically – the marginalisation of political opponents, abuses by immigration services, et. – hardly encourages fans to go there,” Pieth said in an interview with Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger last week.\n\n“For fans, just one piece of advice: avoid the United States! You’ll get a better view on television anyway. Upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don’t behave properly with the authorities, they will be immediately sent home. If they’re lucky …”\n\nBlatter stepped down as Fifa president in 2015 amid several scandals and was replaced by Gianni Infantino, who has forged close ties with Donald Trump.\n\nBlatter and former Uefa chief Michel Platini were last year acquitted definitively on charges stemming from a delayed payment of 2m Swiss francs ($2.5m) Fifa made to Platini in 2011 for consultancy services.\n\nFormer France star Platini said earlier this month that Infantino has “become more of an autocrat” and “he likes the rich and powerful”.",

Has me reflecting on this rivalry. I grew up in the Lansing area so I was always surrounded by the rivalry - everyone I knew had some connection to MSU. My parents went to MSU, though my mom did grad at umich when I was young so I always supported Michigan and ended up going to Michigan. I noticed pretty quickly a lot of my out of state friends didn’t really view the rivalry the same at all which is understandable. Obviously it’s MSU’s main rivalry so growing up around MSU it felt all encompassing. The rivalry used to be fun, I mean it was tense and there was plenty of shit talking and all that but it was fun. Seemed to really shift around the late 2010s, the Devin Bush stomping was a big flash point  and culminated to the point of no return with the tunnel jumping. Now it’s so divisive and toxic I hardly enjoy it anymore. Feels like fans have lost the plot a bit and they have real life hatred towards each other. I know every school has a segment of crazed fans but you’d think Michigan personally harmed a lot of Spartan fans, they legit hate Michigan more than they love their own team. \n\nTLDR- what are your thoughts on the Michigan/ MSU rivalry? Feels really toxic which drains a lot of the fun out of it for me. ",

They still have the East’s best record (8-3) in January and their coaching staff is going to L.A. for the All-Star Game(s).\n\nThree takeaways\n\nLike most of the league, the Pistons have had some offensive issues of late. Prior to Sunday, they had a six-game stretch where they scored just 106.1 points per 100 possessions, with turnovers a recurring issue. Cade Cunningham missed two of those games and shot 18-for-60 (30%) in the other four.\n\nBut the Pistons got to play the Kings on Sunday afternoon, and they had their most efficient offensive performance of the season, scoring 139 points on 100 possessions. Cunningham led eight Pistons in double-figures with 29 points on 13-for-22 shooting. He’s shot worse both in the paint and from 3-point range than he did last season, but his overall efficiency (true shooting percentage) is down just a tick, because his free throw rate (35.9 attempts per 100 shots from the field) is the highest of his career by a wide margin.\n\nDespite the loss to Houston on Friday, the Pistons still have the best record (14-6) in games played between the 17 teams that are currently over .500. Of course, their visit to Denver on Tuesday will be their first game against one of the top three teams in the West.\n\nComing up: The Pistons have spent most of January at home, but they’ll close the month with their final three games in the Mountain or Pacific time zones. They’re an impressive 5-0 in rest-disadvantage games and will be at a disadvantage at Golden State on Friday.\n\nWeek 15: @ DEN, @ PHX, @ GSW, vs. BKN",

You guys should be proud of the team and the players. Rotations, injuries, performance issues, trade rumors, etc.\n\nPeople around the league/nation are saying Pistons are currently the best team in the league. Remember when Bojan Bogdanović was our most consistent shooter? Remember when we made Andre Drummond the highest paid player in the league? Remember when Rodney Stuckey was the future? Remember waiting for Stanley Johnson to get his shot? Remember when Jason Maxiel was being called “Baby Ben Wallace.” Remember ",

In contrast, I think giving a 14-0 lead to Denver’s defense at home would’ve effectively ended the game, given how overwhelmed the Pats looked on offense.
