So I go to the building where I spend most of my calendar year, the football facility. I thought I would receive guidance and clarity, as it was a life-changing experience.

Embiid comes back in a a brace and we somehow win two in a row. Then we split the next two. Game seven we lose by 15 in msg. Embiid has 16 points 6 rebounds. Maxey and VJ shoot 2-16 from deep. Brunson has 42 points. Mikal bridges mom continues to get revenge. \n\nIf only Embiid was healthy we would’ve made the conference finals, so we’ll try again next year where he’ll finally be healthy.",

I mean, many fans and media members didn’t think he could get back to even this level of play. He’s not as impactful on defense these days, but he still has such remarkable touch and skill. I’m happy for Joel and hope he’s able to stay healthy. I think it’s important that the entire load of the team doesn’t rely on him offensively anymore.",

They literally traded a first round pick 7 years in advance for Paul George. Most GM's don't care because they want to win now and secure their next contract. Now the Clippers have been in constant purgatory trying to field together a competitive team since they don't own their own first round picks but can't do so since they have an old declining roster and no assets to get better. \n\nAnd this has constantly happened in the NBA wether it's the Isiah Knicks, the Nets, now with Milwaukee and soon to be Phoenix. These teams become so bad and helpless and fans don't even care.\n\nNBA NEEDS TO STEP UP!",

Just in the last 5 years, we learned about the Mavericks and the Sixers as 2 teams that didnt want to lose their protected pick so they tanked the last of the season to keep it. The NBA is the only major sports league that has pick protections. \n\nGranted, the Mavs still had Luka and went on a Finals run the next year and the Sixers had health problems but viewed themselves as contenders. So maybe not the best example, but the Mavs got Lively with that pick and the Sixers got Edgecombe with theirs, so maybe the Mavs dont make it to the Finals if there was no protection and they lost it like everyone else does.
