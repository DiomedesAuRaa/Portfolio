            "body": "I don’t think Hamilton-led is possible at all and I think Ferrari is constrained by its own organizational decisions.\n\nFerrari is not lost as much people say, from a distance, that distinction matters. A lost team thrashes, panics, reinvents itself at every possible chance. Ferrari does not do that. What Ferrari does is preserve itself, sometimes to the point where preservation becomes resistance. And the closer I look, the clearer it becomes that this is not incompetence or blindness, but the consequence of an organization whose primary risk is not losing races, but damaging the thing that makes it Ferrari.\n\nThat tension runs straight through its most successful era.\n\nThe Schumacher years are often remembered as dominance, but dominance was the output, not the mechanism. What actually happened in that period was the quiet construction of a complete operating system. Jean Todt provided political insulation and long-term authority. Ross Brawn designed clarity into decision-making. Schumacher anchored the system culturally and emotionally. Each role was distinct, but tightly coupled.\n\nTodt understood that Ferrari could not be fixed by cleverness alone. It needed protection from itself. He created a buffer between Maranello’s internal gravity and the racing team’s daily reality. Brawn, in turn, stripped complexity down to what mattered with clear hierarchies and specially direct accountability that lead to a management room with fewer voices but sharper decisions. Schumacher then did something that is still underappreciated specially considering most media portrayed him as a ruthless cold person: he made the system human.\n\nIn the garage, he didn’t just demand performance but he invested in building relationships with people. From engineers, mechanics, factory staff, both sides of the garage. He knew who mattered, and he made them feel it. In an organization built on tenure and identity, that mattered more than any role an hierarchy. Ferrari didn’t feel disrupted in that era. It felt aligned.\n\nWhen that Ferrari ended it, not because it failed but because time moved on, the same principles reappeared elsewhere. Ross Brawn rebuilt a team almost from nothing using the same fundamentals: clarity of authority, ruthless simplification, protection from noise. The miracle of 2009 wasn’t a miracle. It was the same system, applied in a different context, under different constraints.\n\nThat matters, because it proves that Ferrari’s golden era was not an accident of personalities or budgets. It was an organizational choice and that choice has been absent ever since.\n\nWhat followed that arragmentent was not failure in the obvious sense. Ferrari remained competitive. It hired champions. It built fast cars at times. But it never again committed to a single, stable operating model long enough for culture to compound. Leadership changed. Technical direction shifted. Responsibility blurred, then re-centralized, then blurred again. The organization retained its memory but lost its spine.\n\nThis becomes more dangerous in the modern era, because Formula 1 no longer allows slow correction. Cost caps and homologation mean that hesitation is punished structurally. You don’t get to “learn next weekend” anymore. You commit to a design, and you live with it until you can fix.\n\nFerrari instead of continuity (specially when you compare to RB, Mercedes) has spent recent years in a state that looks like a shuffling deck: continual realignment or more like a perpetual adjustment. Team principals change. Technical directors rotate. Reporting lines are revised. Each move is defensible in isolation. Together, they prevent long-term coherence.\n\nAnd Ferrari is uniquely vulnerable to that pattern because it is not embedded in the UK’s fluid talent ecosystem. Maranello’s strength has always been continuity. Long tenure. Deep institutional memory. Loyalty. But continuity without stable leadership turns into inertia. Habits persist while direction resets. The organization remembers who it is better than where it is going.\n\nThis is where the contrast with Hamilton becomes instructive, not critical.\n\nHamilton is an extraordinary optimizer. Give him a working platform and he will extract everything from it as he he sharpens edges and finds limits. But he does not arrive as a cultural architect and never did, nor did Ferrari hire him as one. He arrived broken, after years of exhaustion and turbulence, looking for a final competitive chapter to prove he's thill the champinhon that he always was. \n\nFerrari hired him for reasons that go beyond winning, and the market understood that instantly. The stock reaction wasn’t about championships alone, it was about closing a narrative, the best at the best. Hamilton amplified Ferrari’s global relevance overnight. In brand terms, the move paid for itself immediately. Everyone knows that Ferrari’s revenues still come primarily from cars and parts, but its valuation behaves like that of a luxury house. Formula 1 is not the core business; it is the amplifier. Winning strengthens the myth. Not winning does not destroy it. That asymmetry changes how risk is priced internally.\n\nMost teams must win to justify their existence. Ferrari must endure.\n\nThis explains why Ferrari is cautious with disruption. Why it values continuity. Why it resists tearing itself apart, even when the sport seems to demand it. It also explains why genuine reinvention only happens when someone is empowered to stand between the racing team and the brand long enough for execution to dominate.\n\nWhether Ferrari is still willing to recreate that kind of authority structure, in a world where the brand can generate enormous value even without total on-track dominance, is the real question.\n\nIf I were Charles, I’d be asking whether my career can afford to wait for Ferrari to become the kind of team that turns a consistently fast driver into a champion, rather than another talented house name folded quietly into its history.",

            "body": "The single seater director of the FIA, Nikolas Tombazis, has revealed his predictions for the early stages of the 2026 [Formula 1](https://www.motorsportweek.com/series/single-seater/formula-1/) season, amid the sport’s new regulations cycle.\n\n2026 sees the introduction of the long-awaited new set of [technical regulations](https://www.fia.com/F126) which renders the season scarcely unable to predict, amid a plethora of major changes.\n\nThese include the new 50-50 hybrid power units and aerodynamic revisions for the cars, which will overall be smaller and lighter.\n\nF1’s shift to further electrification has been a major cornerstone in these regulations, which naturally has led to further speculation as to which Original Engine Manufacturer \\[OEM\\] may have been the most successful.\n\n“I would expect the engine to be the main factor initially, the ICE. We obviously have newcomers and new ICE regulations, so we expect some initial differentiation,”\n\n“But we also believe that we’ve also put in place procedures to, let’s say, enable people to gradually catch up. So we believe that it’s a temporary matter in terms of performance differentiations.\n\n“Then we have completely new aerodynamic regulations as well. Naturally, there will be some solutions that are better and some that are worse. There will be some initial convergence, I guess, over the first six months or one year.”\n\n# F1 2026 end expected to be ‘closer’ than 2025 – Tombazis\n\nThe last major regulation change came about in 2014, when the V6 hybrid era was fully introduced, and saw some sizeable gaps in competitiveness across the grid.\n\nThis has led to inevitable concern that a similar eventuality will transpire, but while Tombazis expects there to be some gulfs early on, he believes the season will end potentiall more competitive than the 2025 campaign.\n\n“For 2026, I would not expect to have the grid quite as close as what we had last year,” he said. “But I would expect that the converged grid \\[later on\\] is closer than what it was in 2025.”\n\nIt appears that progress across the grid has been made already, with Pirelli reporting that its second round of simulator testing saw results much closer between all teams compared to the first.\n\nTombazis is therefore somewhat confident but cautious about just how close the grid from top to bottom will be.\n\n“Reasonably, but we cannot be sure because we don’t have detailed data from the teams, so we don’t know how much downforce they have now or how much horsepower they have,” he said.\n\n“Initially, I think there may be some variation, but we are pretty sure that the converged performance should lead to a smaller \\[more compact\\] grid.”\n\nOf course, gaps in speed between teams could, from the perspective of some fans, form a lack of entertainment factor for them, but Tombazis pointed out that this will not be an issue.\n\n“I think what determines the closeness of the grid is not necessarily the gap between the first and the last,” he explained.\n\n“If one or two teams are in a bit of trouble initially, I don’t think that determines how exciting a championship is.\n\n“Usually that’s determined by how close, let’s say, the people in the top half are, so the teams battling for points and wins. And I think there we will have a reasonably close field.”",

Hausmann says he still intends to finish his degree at U-M.\n\n\"From Uganda to America, with a full heart, I’m officially medically retiring from football. This game has shaped me, but now it’s time to focus on my true purpose on this earth full time. I’ll be finishing my degree at the University of Michigan. Thank you to everyone who has supported me on this journey the best is still ahead.\"\n\nIn early December, Hausmann explained that he departed the program and the country after an unfortunate experience with U-M staff member.\n\n\"This is why I left America,\" wrote Hausmann. \"You tell one staff member about an experience I had with my faith. An experience where I was trying to figure out what was going on, still knowing I was in season. So I thought it would be smart to talk to someone. So I go to the building where I spend most of my calendar year, the football facility. I thought I would receive guidance and clarity, as it was a life-changing experience. After hearing what I had to say, I got put in the category of a mental patient who is going to end their life. If anyone has a clue who I was, they know that’s the last thing I would ever do.\"\n\n#GoBlue",

The fact of the matter is, the deep bench that allows us to plug and play whoever’s skill set is needed at any point in time is what gives us  an advantage over most other teams. (And those teams don’t have Cade)\n\nWhat happens when we got against a team with amazing interior defense like Cleveland? We sub in players like Dannis to bomb them from outside\n\nWhat happens when the other team is a bit older and slow? Ivey speeds past everyone and hits a ton of easy transition lays \n\nWhat about when the starting lineup is off all together ? Sasser gets his own bucket off the dribble \n\nObviously there are more situations where players like BBall Paul and Levert shine (although Levert has been off lately) but remeber Levert is 38% from three this season. \n\nWe are young. Our window is HUGE as long as Cade and Duren are here. Everyone on this team understands their roles and are ready to play any given night and don’t complain to the media when they are a healthy scratch. They understand that some nights aren’t going to be theirs. They play hard defensively no matter what the score is.This is the team others dream of. No reason to mess it up for an offensive player who takes away from the defensive identity of the team and makes others work even harder to compensate their lack of defensive focus. ",

He's okay on drives and with his size and speed is not a negative on defense.\n\nSasser is a 6'1 SG who is asked to play PG but it doesn't come natural to him. He's a real shooter who can drive a bit but mostly to keep defenders honest and ends up in floaters or mid-range rather than at the basket. He's active defensively but is too small not to be a liability against larger guards or on switches.\n\nDaniss is the better player and should be kept as the backup point. Sass is absolutely good enough as a shooter to keep (especially on our team that needs shooting) but is more like 3rd or 4th guard off the bench. Those guys often get squeezed out of rotations and off teams.",
