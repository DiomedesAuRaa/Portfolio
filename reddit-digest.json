This game has shaped me, but now it’s time to focus on my true purpose on this earth full time. I’ll be finishing my degree at the University of Michigan. Thank you to everyone who has supported me on this journey the best is still ahead.\"\n\nIn early December, Hausmann explained that he departed the program and the country after an unfortunate experience with U-M staff member.\n\n\"This is why I left America,\" wrote Hausmann. \"You tell one staff member about an experience I had with my faith. An experience where I was trying to figure out what was going on, still knowing I was in season. So I thought it would be smart to talk to someone. So I go to the building where I spend most of my calendar year, the football facility. I thought I would receive guidance and clarity, as it was a life-changing experience. After hearing what I had to say, I got put in the category of a mental patient who is going to end their life.

Adding games on and breaking records due to more games feels cheap and not as meaningful. \n\nYes it would mean that new game schedules would mean all new current records, but those will quickly catch up decent records over the years.",

Calvin ended up finishing the 2012 season with 770 routes (which is the most ever regardless of 16 vs. 17 games) and JSN finished with 495 routes.\n\nSometimes it should have an asterisk, sometimes it shouldn't.",
