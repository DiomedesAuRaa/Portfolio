His reputation as an elite SMG feels like it’s fallen off hard, and I’m trying to understand why.\n\nHis résumé is strong: ROTY, 3× chips, 1× ring, 2× All-Star. He was the best SMG in Vanguard and top-tier in MWII, a demon on Seattle Surge, and still very good on OpTic. He also won a World Championship in 2024.\n\nSince leaving OpTic and joining Falcons, though, it feels like the community has completely moved on. Players like Simp, Shotzzy, aBeZy, HyDra, Huke, etc. are now ranked above him with little debate.\n\nWas this due to role, team situation, meta changes, or just recency bias? Curious what actually caused him to fall out of the elite SMG discussion.",
