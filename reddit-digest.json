Those conference percentages were based on previous CFP appearances among member schools in each conference.\n\nThere also will no longer be performance bonuses for advancing in the field for most teams. Miami earned around $20 million for its run this season. Next year, it will be a flat number. The team at the bottom of the SEC or Big Ten standings will earn more than the top teams from other conferences that make the field. That financial layout was one point of Florida State’s lawsuit against the ACC.\n\nNotre Dame will receive more than $12 million annually, with a $6 million boost for making the field, putting its payout near the Big Ten/SEC levels in those years it earns an invite.\"",

I definitely just want to send wishes to everybody up there who's been affected. I have a lot of friends, family, neighbors, especially close in that area. My parents' house is three blocks from where the latest incident happened. I know that area well. My sisters would always get donuts at the donut shop on that street. My grandma's favorite Greek restaurant is on that street. It's all very close. Seeing that happen definitely takes you back. You never want to see anything like that happen. I definitely think we're too advanced as a species, just plain and simple, for things like that to be happening. No matter what your opinions are or what your beliefs are, you should be able to agree that nobody needs to be dying on the street. I wasn't there. I don't have a full picture of everything going on. I can't really speak on the details and what happened and what transpired. I just feel for the families of anybody who's lost their life up there. I'm wishing safety for everybody.\"",

        "selftext": "As soon as the visit came to an end, Staehling committed to Michigan, enrolled in classes and began participating in offseason workouts under new U-M head coach Kyle Whittingham.\n\n“It was essentially a one-way ticket,” Staehling said. “I came down here with a suitcase, a backpack and some dreams. Things have been going a million miles an hour, but I’m truly grateful for it. Everyone here has been extremely nice. The culture is great. The new coaching staff has been great. It’s been a blast. I’m super happy and pumped I’m here.”\n\n... “The professors here are so nice,” Staehling said. “They are making class so awesome. The workouts have been good. The staff is doing excellent work. They are bringing the juice for sure. Everything we are doing is with intention. It’s cool because I’m not used to eight strength coaches in one weight room. I’m used to three or four and sometimes two. It’s an adjustment as far as resources go. I’m just so thankful for this opportunity.”\n\n... “NDSU had a really strong culture and some really good people,” Staehling said. “It was definitely a hard place to leave. I wanted to find a place with a similar culture. I’m used to toughness, accountability, grittiness and hard work. That’s in my blood. Michigan is just like that. I felt that right away when I got here. Michigan is the winningest program in history. It’s hard-nosed football. I just love it.”\n\n... “(Kyle Whittingham, Alex Wittingham, and Jay Hill) are class acts,” Staehling said. “I can just tell from having conversations with them that they want the best for you and are going to push you. They know ball. I’m excited to soak up all of the information. I’m going to be a sponge. They are fantastic coaches. Everything I just said came from just a couple of conversations. That speaks volumes.”\n\n... “I’m a gritty football player,” Staehling said. “I’m going to spring to the ball every single time. I’m going to come downhill, fill the gap and hit someone really hard. I will overcommunicate. I feel like I show on my film that I get everybody on the same page as a MIKE. I define my play as gritty and smart. I’m a hard worker. I want to get more athletic here and showcase that a little bit more.”\n\n... “My vision for the team is to win a national championship,” Staehling said. “But you can’t do that without grinding and putting in the work every single day. I pride myself in being a leader. I want to be someone that guys can lean on. I was a leader at NDSU. I want to do that here. I want to dominate at the role I have. The ultimate goal is to start and put my best foot forward every single day.”",
