If he does nothing then teams will just get away with it, but turning into a flopper is a horrible alternative too.\n\nNBA needs to address this phenomenon because it's not good for the game. If certain big men mean the rules no longer apply for defenses, it will only encourage more flopping. It's a lose lose\n\nEdit: wanna add that I am not the type of fan who condemns any player for flopping. I have a \"don't hate the player, hate the game\" mentality. It's a league issue. I think players can flop for different reasons but ultimately is a bad product that no one wants to see. However, the league rewards the behavior so I am not gonna hate on any individual for simply trying to take advantage of the exploits and be competitive within the given circumstances and set of rules.",

Across the street, you can see hundreds of Jays fans walking to the game, oblivious that Carter was 50 feet away and signing autographs at a free event.\n\n\nSince it wasn't that busy, he spent more time with everyone and was just one of the friendliest guys. Had him sign my jersey (that is now in a jersey case) and he signed a few of the baseball cards they had to giveaway.
