This completely discredits the moronic meme that 'everything has to be perfect' for Goff to succeed.\n\nIn fact, even 5 as misleading, as Caleb Williams's and (rookie) Cam Ward's pressure rates are the product of them holding onto the ball too long, not just OL play. Goff probably had the third worst pass protection in the league. \n\nBy the way look at your beloved Stafford, Goff haters. Goff was pressured 31.7% more (5.8 percentage points\\*).\n\nI wonder how Goff would've done with Stafford's pressure rate? I wonder how Stafford would've done with Goff's pressure rate? Would Stafford have had an MVP season playing for Detroit this year? Would he have done as well as Goff did?\n\n\\* Percentage points differences are different than percentages, go back to high school stats if you don't understand this. Goff was pressured 24.1% versus 18.3% for Stafford. So Goff was pressured 31.7% (5.8/24.1) more, a massive difference.",

Defensively we have 5 pro bowlers that we need playing at form. Campbell, Hutchison, Kirby, BB, and Alim. We have to expect these 5 to get back to how they were playing in early 24 when they were healthy, aside from that I trust Amik, Barnes, Muhammad, Williams will be ok. Aside from that we have opportunities to improve this defense at corner, defensive tackle and rotational edge rushers. The biggest things the defense needs to a good pass rush up the middle, unpredictable blitzes (Aaron Glenn did this) and a more aggressive approach to playing the ball and going for the pick (this is where we miss Kirby. The other coaching critique is we need to know the type of game we are playing (less punts against the Rams in a shootout, more punts in Philly when both offenses are struggling. I didn’t put special teams stats, but that looked bad this year too. We need to draft depth, no more trading up for project players please. Other than that, in Brad we trust. Let’s fucking go, we aren’t far off but we need to move forward, and we can do it!",

Defenses packing the paint, sagging off of Ausar and Harris, taking away the Cade/Duren lob and trapping Cade later in the game. \n\nEvery shot that he takes that isn't a wide open dunk is essentially a turnover, or he's gonna go to the line and probably miss both free throws.  Teams in the playoffs will exploit this. \n\nPersonally I almost like what I'm seeing from Ron Holland more at this point in the season. He's a great defender himself, he's not afraid to shoot the ball (even if he's not the best shooter), he's a much better shot creator, and I trust him more at the free throw line. He's gives up a bit in size but the trade off is worth it. \n\nThe Pistons might have a make a tough decision with Ausar and either move him to the bench or even test the market for him to see if they can upgrade their shooting on the perimeter.
