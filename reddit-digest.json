        "selftext": "A non-punting stat that I love is turnover worthy plays. Interception counts fluctuate but TWP give an idea of how often a passer is putting the ball in harms way. But, this made me wonder, who is the luckiest? Which QBs have been lucky this year? That was the goal here.\n\nTo do that, I utilized PFF. PFF counts a TWP as \"a pass that has a high percentage chance to be intercepted or a poor job of taking care of the ball and fumbling.\" Note the last part, it includes fumbled plays as well. Unfortunately, I did not know a quick and easy way to to get individual player lost fumble numbers, so I fudged it a little. I looked at the individual player fumble grades, then took their compliments (compliment of 70 is 30, 65 and 35), multiplied by 1/100 to make it a percent, then multiplied that by the fumble count and added it to the interception count. Its not perfect, don't shoot me, but I think its good enough for this curiosity exercise of giving an idea of how often a fumble is attributed to the QB. I then took the new combined turnover count and divided it by the total TWP. Lastly, I made that a percent. Simple maths, nothing groundbreaking.\n\nThe higher the Luck number, the more often a players TWP results in a true turnover. 1.00 is dead even. For some players, they have more turnovers than TWP. Joe Burrow is truly unlucky.\n\nMinimum 15 aimed passes",

        "selftext": "Before you read further, understand this. I am not saying that the \"Passer Rating\" is perfect. Or that improvements (such as attempts by PFF) should not be attempted. What I am saying, is that there is a beauty in the simplicity and strange numbers of the passer rating.\n\n  \n158.3 is a number that if said to a complete stranger, few would understand. And for good reason; it is a dumb, weird, random number. No one has ever, ever, in the history of humanity, set out to make 158.3 the target of any equation. Which is part of what makes it such a beautiful number to arrive at.\n\n  \nWhen calculating mathematics, there are things you can strive for. As pattern recognizing animals, we like nice numbers, especially base 10 numbers, but that's another story. But, are things in life ever out of only 10, or 100 really? Maybe. But sit back, and think. You've had things above 100 before. Some thing, or some time, that surpassed your expectations of what you thought was possible? How far above your expectations could those things be measured? A 30 year-old wine, a meticulously planned dessert at the end of a many-many course dinner, a drunken visit to Taco Chain with friends after a long night out?\n\n  \n\"100\" is never the full story, and it never will be. Because, lets face it, life is not that clean. What is that clean? Math, unfortunately. We did not invent it (or discover it based on who you ask) because it was clean. Or because it solved simple problems. We solved those long before math. Math exists because problems arise that we must make sense of, to which the answers were not simple. Our survival, and the thriving of our entire species, has depended on discovering this. It is not simple, because it can't be. Something which explains something else, can not be as simple as the thing it explains. \n\n  \nThat being said, passer rating is the \"drunken napkin math\" of football math. It was the first time some guys got together at the bar and shouted \"Fuck you, my guy is better, and I can prove it, with math!\" and... they did. And surprisingly, they did it well. Look at the factors that go into it. Completion percentage. Yards per attempt. Touchdown percentage. Interception percentage. Every factor that is calculated today, in any system, operates off of a basis of one of these four quadrants of passer rating. Each of these stats, on their own, is fundamental to your opinion of any quarterback you have an opinion about. And it's not because football was created around this system, but because this system does an excellent job of explaining this game.\n\n  \nAnd the rating system is better for it, especially given the odd numerology. There are many things in your own life that you rank obscurely. It's easy to rank the Godfather trilogy over the Land Before Time trilogy (arguably) but what about Boondock Saints over Donnie Darko? Or Super Bad over Forgetting Sarah Marshall? Subjectivity and objectivity collide. Are any of these \"objectively\" better than the other? Obviously not, (arguments expected) but why? Because attempting to move from one to the other forces debate, and passer rating does this oddly well.\n\n  \nAs stated earlier, it's a weird number. Having a debate with some one over 3, or 5, or 13, or 28 points in passer rating is weird and arbitrary. It gives so much room for discussion and argument. But it's also great that it isn't chasing anything. It exists as a simple calculation that anyone can look up and do. Having an \"end goal\", which would have been an implicit bias, was never even in mind in its formulation. The math was all that was left to do the talking. And the numbers that comprise it MAKE SENSE. Should one number of any quadrant matter more today than it did before? Maybe. But one number also used to mean more. And a different one could matter more tomorrow. But the fundamentals are all there.\n\n  \nIs passer rating perfect? No. Will a perfect passer rating exist? No. The beauty is the capacity in which the context of the past can be applied to the status of the present and the unknown of the future. In that the core fundamentals of quarterback play can be broken down and examined over time. We can see numbers that were similar to each other before, and today, and still have valid conversations about them both. Like how Norm Van Brocklin compares to Otto Graham and Tom Brady compares to Peyton Manning, and the numbers still make sense. Can you compare both sets? Not really. But can you compare house prices within the last 50 years? Not really.\n\n  \nPasser rating is weird, but it's cool, and it's old. It works in an extremely primitive way, but it still works today. Maybe when we reach a point where quarterbacks are constantly hitting 158.3 we can reevaluate. But for now I'm alright with the fact that using weird old math, a few strangers can understand how good a dude is at throwing a ball.",

The 158.3 cap is just an accident of this formulation. It had no meaning, and the idea of any QB hitting the 158.3 cap was laughable at the time. Nowadays, it can happen, so attention gets drawn to how weird the cap of 158.3 is. \n\nWhy was this posted at midnight on Christmas? Idk. Why am I scrolling Reddit at midnight on Christmas?

        "selftext": "To me, this is LeBron’s most impactful single season of his career, end to end. The cavs won 66 games, and LeBron’s on court +15 net rating was the highest of his career, which includes seasons with Wade + Bosh, and Kyrie + Love. The Cavs had some strong role players like Varejao, Ben Wallace, Delonte, but no real top 20 type players. LeBron’s **on-off that year was also a career high +21**\n\nFor some context on how high a +15 net rating is, here’s the some superstar seasons since 1997 who **have crossed: +15 net (only started being recorded since 1997)**:\n\n- 2005 Duncan, +17. Notable teammates include *Manu, Tony Parker, Robert Horry*\n\n- 2015-2017 Steph, +17, +18, +17. Notable teammates include *Draymond, KD, Klay, Iguodala*\n\n- 2025/2026 Shai, +17, +18.3. Notable teammates include *Chet, J-dub* then role players like *I-hart, Caruso, Cason Wallace*\n\n- 2020 Giannis, +16. Notable teammates include *Middleton, Lopez*, and role players like *George Hill, Bledsoe, DDV*\n\n- 1998 Shaq, +16. Notable teammates include *Eddie Jones, Nick Van Excel, Kobe Bryant, Robert Horry*\n\n- 2008 KG: +16.5. Notable teammates include *Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, Rondo, Tony Allen*. \n\nHere are some players who have never hit the +15 mark in a regular season:\n\nJokic, Kobe, Dirk, Harden, CP3, Nash, Tatum\n\nTo go deeper into how much impact LeBron had on those Cavs, RAPM is a well known statistical approach that attempts to go beyond on just court and on/off net rating by adjusting for what teammates you play with, and the strength of lineups you faced. LeBron’s 3-year 2009-2011 stretch is the **2nd highest stretch since 1997**. His 5-year 2007-2011 stretch is the **highest since 1997**. https://www.nbarapm.com/player/LeBron_James\n\nIn the playoffs across 3 series, LeBron then averaged an absolutely mind boggling **47.5 pts/100** on +10 efficiency adjusting for opponent defense, which is the highest playoff scoring rate of all time within a minimum of 3 series played. This included a 38, 8, 8 series against the number 1 defense Orlando Magic, where the Cavs posted a monstrous +10 offense when LeBron was on court, but also got cooked by a Magic team somehow shooting 41% from 3 and Dwight cooking Varejao/Ilgauskas",
