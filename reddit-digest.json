They smash us twice”\n\nThe most media savvy answer is to not answer.  “I’m not going there.  We played and they won.” But I’m not going to fault a kid for not being that on their toes and I’m not going to fault them for refusing to say “we lose again”.

We have good RB depth, but Beck likes to rotate RB's more than any other OC we have had. Moa has the ability to play more positions than the other two, and like Hiter it's an early enrollee. With that being said Moa and Hiter obviously have much better chance to be the most impactful out of those three. I personally think that Moa might have a slight edge due to the amount of positions he can play. I guess we will see!",
