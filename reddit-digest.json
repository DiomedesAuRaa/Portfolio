Because the team has not yet started operating as the Las Vegas Athletics, it cannot easily produce the kind of marketplace evidence, such as sales figures, advertising spend, media recognition, and consumer perception, that would normally overcome a descriptiveness refusal.\n\n> There is also a clear legal precedent that prior trademark registrations do not guarantee approval of new trademarks. From the USPTO’s perspective, Oakland Athletics and Las Vegas Athletics are legally different marks, and the agency is well within its rights to hold that line and deny these new trademark applications.\n\n> Still, this case has the potential to push the law in a new direction. At a practical level, it is hard to argue that the public would perceive ‘Las Vegas Athletics’ as anything other than the existing MLB franchise. That opens the door to more creative legal arguments, but pursuing them would likely require an appeal to federal court.\n\n> One other option at this point would be for the team to retain a survey expert. A properly designed consumer perception survey could provide powerful evidence that the public overwhelmingly associates ‘Las Vegas Athletics’ with the Athletics ownership group and its MLB team. That type of data can move the needle with examiners, especially with these types of refusals.\n\n> Do I expect the Athletics to ultimately secure these registrations?\n\n> Yes.",

Rolen got in 2 ballots later which would pace Pettitte to get in on his final ballot\n\nLarry Walker who got 21% on his 7th ballot up to 54% on his 9th ballot and also shot up in his final ballot to get inducted by just 6 votes in year 10.\n\nPeople associated with PEDs usually have fairly consistent support, Bonds started out at 35% and stayed there, while slowly climbing into the 50s and 60s, topping out at 66% on his last ballot, and PED users normally have a hard ceiling.\n\nThis feels different to me, I can't help but wonder if Pettitte could break through that ceiling since a lot of voters are treating his case differently from other PED users, and maybe an outside shot he gets in during his final year? It's clear that he has no pathway in via Vet Committee, so imagine what happens if he actually gets voted in by the writers...",

Many highly-ranked prospects like that have a decent floor *and* a high ceiling: you could get .270/.350/.600, but you know that even hitting .220 can still be useful as a power hitter.\n\nI'm thinking of prospects like Lazaro Montes, who have 80-grade physical tools but sky-high strikeout rates even in the low minors. Prospects where scouts are always saying \"if he can shorten the swing, he has the potential to be an all star level DH\".\n\nAlso, I'm talking about people who don't really project as an even decent defender in any position, where the bat does all the work.\n\nAnecdotally, I feel like players like this are usually signed out of Latin America when they're young; I assume this is because people with an eye-popping physique are scouted more since eyes are naturally drawn to them, especially when they're hitting homers at 14 year old or whatever?\n\nThis might be a really narrow criteria but I can't really think of anyone.",

He uses his leverage and strength to crush balls, and he has a two-homer game against No. 1 overall pick Mark Appel and the TD Ameritrade College Home Run Derby title on his resume.

Now since paco got lat I’ve been a little reserved on how he impact and performance granted he was top 5 bo6. \n\nBut something tells me paco may be the main catalyst on what’s been going on with LAT. There’s been rumors that Dan and paco didn’t fuck with each, reason why they dropped him. Even Dan had change his entire play style on that team. You pick up Ken albeit didn’t have a good bo6 season but is essentially a glue guy and team first player. Then turnaround prolly drop him b4 the major? Where he’s not even your worst player statistically. \n\nNow I’m not blaming hydra solely, but to me he does seem like an outlier on this team from the others. Hydra is a superstar but to me he yet prove that he can preform consistently around superstar players. Skyz, Kis, Preston, and sib are not superstars and are good role players/ enablers on a team. Are we certain that hydra can play alongside the likes of scrap and Abezy. Because of now he’s been abysmal in hp. \n\n Ps. This isn’t coming from nowhere as well. Haggy said himself this team falls is on paco maturity, because he wants to play certain way. ",

        "selftext": "Hélène Hendriks does not have fond memories of Diego Costa. The former Atlético Madrid striker behaved rudely during an interview in the coronavirus era.\n\n\n\nHendriks was a reporter during the Champions League round of 16 match between Liverpool and Atlético (2-3) in March 2020. While the Netherlands was already in lockdown, the stadium was still full. “In the end, 41 of the people who were in that stadium died of COVID-19,” Hendriks said in the HNM podcast.\n\n\n\nAfter the match, Hendriks conducted interviews. “First I had Virgil van Dijk, then Diego Costa came. Do you know what Diego Costa did? He walked up and deliberately coughed in the face of everyone standing there.” The presenter found the striker's action distasteful. “I don't get angry easily, but I wanted to run after him and say, ‘What are you doing to me?’”\n\n\n\n“He coughed right in my face,” emphasizes Hendriks, who was not wearing a face mask at the time. “But I was attached to a wire for the connection with the Netherlands, and I was walking behind Diego Costa, so the whole camera fell over. I didn't know what had happened to me. I thought it was outrageous.” Two days later, Hendriks had the coronavirus, she says. “What a jerk! What an asshole!” says Noa Vahle.\n\n\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)",

        "selftext": "Full Statement:\n\nLothar Matthäus on Lennart Karl's statement of Real Madrid being his dream club: \"I think it's great when someone has self-confidence even at 17. Setting goals has absolutely nothing to do with arrogance. I find it honest, but not pretentious or arrogant. Real Madrid simply has that kind of mystique. Bayern Munich is in a similar position, but often you want to try something new in life. You can't say, \"I'll stay at Bayern my whole life,\" like Thomas Müller – that's unique. Ultimately, everyone has a goal at some point.\n\nI think it's all fine. It shows that Karl is ambitious and believes in himself. He knows he has to perform exceptionally well at Bayern to even be on Real Madrid's radar. He hasn't said he wants to play for Real in the next two years. It's his dream. Dreams can come true, but you have to work for them, and Bayern would benefit from that. If Karl becomes so good that Real Madrid negotiates with him, he'll first have to achieve something extraordinary at another club [Bayern].\n\nI, too, would have loved to play for Real Madrid. I was named World Player of the Year in 1990/91, and suddenly Real Madrid were knocking on my door. I would have loved to go, but I still had a contract. That's why the transfer didn't work out back then. Real and I had an agreement, but Inter didn't want to let me go for a high transfer fee. I, too, had dreams: I always said that I wanted to play for a big club, become a national team player, and be part of the World Cup squad. At some point, dreams just get bigger. Four years ago, Karl probably would have said that he wanted to play in the Bundesliga – probably for Bayern Munich.\n\nKarl simply sees what's possible. It's not just about the sporting aspect. It's also about a new, different, and better quality of life, better weather, the biggest club in the world. And we've often seen that the best footballers in the world don't come from the Bundesliga, but rather from a league that receives more global attention.\"",
