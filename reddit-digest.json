I’m a newer fan trying to fill the winter break void by watching an old season and I thought 2016 would be a great place to start because I‘m a big fan of Mercedes/want to know more recent F1 history. Unfortunately I only have time to watch about half of the races that happened in 2016 with how my schedule is looking, and I was wondering if anyone had suggestions for which races were more entertaining/important/controversial/fun to watch haha. Please let me know what you guys think! And happy new year :)",

He also won a World Championship in 2024.\n\nSince leaving OpTic and joining Falcons, though, it feels like the community has completely moved on. Players like Simp, Shotzzy, aBeZy, HyDra, Huke, etc. are now ranked above him with little debate.\n\nWas this due to role, team situation, meta changes, or just recency bias?
