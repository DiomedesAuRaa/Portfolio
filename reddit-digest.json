Because the team has not yet started operating as the Las Vegas Athletics, it cannot easily produce the kind of marketplace evidence, such as sales figures, advertising spend, media recognition, and consumer perception, that would normally overcome a descriptiveness refusal.\n\n> There is also a clear legal precedent that prior trademark registrations do not guarantee approval of new trademarks. From the USPTO’s perspective, Oakland Athletics and Las Vegas Athletics are legally different marks, and the agency is well within its rights to hold that line and deny these new trademark applications.\n\n> Still, this case has the potential to push the law in a new direction. At a practical level, it is hard to argue that the public would perceive ‘Las Vegas Athletics’ as anything other than the existing MLB franchise. That opens the door to more creative legal arguments, but pursuing them would likely require an appeal to federal court.\n\n> One other option at this point would be for the team to retain a survey expert. A properly designed consumer perception survey could provide powerful evidence that the public overwhelmingly associates ‘Las Vegas Athletics’ with the Athletics ownership group and its MLB team. That type of data can move the needle with examiners, especially with these types of refusals.\n\n> Do I expect the Athletics to ultimately secure these registrations?\n\n> Yes.",

Many highly-ranked prospects like that have a decent floor *and* a high ceiling: you could get .270/.350/.600, but you know that even hitting .220 can still be useful as a power hitter.\n\nI'm thinking of prospects like Lazaro Montes, who have 80-grade physical tools but sky-high strikeout rates even in the low minors. Prospects where scouts are always saying \"if he can shorten the swing, he has the potential to be an all star level DH\".\n\nAlso, I'm talking about people who don't really project as an even decent defender in any position, where the bat does all the work.\n\nAnecdotally, I feel like players like this are usually signed out of Latin America when they're young; I assume this is because people with an eye-popping physique are scouted more since eyes are naturally drawn to them, especially when they're hitting homers at 14 year old or whatever?\n\nThis might be a really narrow criteria but I can't really think of anyone.",

He also has drawn comparisons to Hall of Famer Dave Winfield, who played in eight straight All-Star Games for the Yankees, and Giancarlo Stanton.\n\nThe 32nd overall pick in the 2013 Draft and recipient of a $1.8 million bonus, Judge has huge power potential. He uses his leverage and strength to crush balls, and he has a two-homer game against No. 1 overall pick Mark Appel and the TD Ameritrade College Home Run Derby title on his resume. With his long arms, his swing can get very long as well, which results in strikeouts and reduces his ability to hit for average.”\n\nBelieve he fits the sustained success criteria.",

        "selftext": "Hélène Hendriks does not have fond memories of Diego Costa. The former Atlético Madrid striker behaved rudely during an interview in the coronavirus era.\n\n\n\nHendriks was a reporter during the Champions League round of 16 match between Liverpool and Atlético (2-3) in March 2020. While the Netherlands was already in lockdown, the stadium was still full. “In the end, 41 of the people who were in that stadium died of COVID-19,” Hendriks said in the HNM podcast.\n\n\n\nAfter the match, Hendriks conducted interviews. “First I had Virgil van Dijk, then Diego Costa came. Do you know what Diego Costa did? He walked up and deliberately coughed in the face of everyone standing there.” The presenter found the striker's action distasteful. “I don't get angry easily, but I wanted to run after him and say, ‘What are you doing to me?’”\n\n\n\n“He coughed right in my face,” emphasizes Hendriks, who was not wearing a face mask at the time. “But I was attached to a wire for the connection with the Netherlands, and I was walking behind Diego Costa, so the whole camera fell over. I didn't know what had happened to me. I thought it was outrageous.” Two days later, Hendriks had the coronavirus, she says. “What a jerk! What an asshole!” says Noa Vahle.\n\n\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)",

        "selftext": "Full Statement:\n\nLothar Matthäus on Lennart Karl's statement of Real Madrid being his dream club: \"I think it's great when someone has self-confidence even at 17. Setting goals has absolutely nothing to do with arrogance. I find it honest, but not pretentious or arrogant. Real Madrid simply has that kind of mystique. Bayern Munich is in a similar position, but often you want to try something new in life. You can't say, \"I'll stay at Bayern my whole life,\" like Thomas Müller – that's unique. Ultimately, everyone has a goal at some point.\n\nI think it's all fine. It shows that Karl is ambitious and believes in himself. He knows he has to perform exceptionally well at Bayern to even be on Real Madrid's radar. He hasn't said he wants to play for Real in the next two years. It's his dream. Dreams can come true, but you have to work for them, and Bayern would benefit from that. If Karl becomes so good that Real Madrid negotiates with him, he'll first have to achieve something extraordinary at another club [Bayern].\n\nI, too, would have loved to play for Real Madrid. I was named World Player of the Year in 1990/91, and suddenly Real Madrid were knocking on my door. I would have loved to go, but I still had a contract. That's why the transfer didn't work out back then. Real and I had an agreement, but Inter didn't want to let me go for a high transfer fee. I, too, had dreams: I always said that I wanted to play for a big club, become a national team player, and be part of the World Cup squad. At some point, dreams just get bigger. Four years ago, Karl probably would have said that he wanted to play in the Bundesliga – probably for Bayern Munich.\n\nKarl simply sees what's possible. It's not just about the sporting aspect. It's also about a new, different, and better quality of life, better weather, the biggest club in the world. And we've often seen that the best footballers in the world don't come from the Bundesliga, but rather from a league that receives more global attention.\"",
