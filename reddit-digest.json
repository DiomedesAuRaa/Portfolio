I played scout team offense on his side of the practice field for several years - its not a plug and play system. It takes a lot of mental reps and thinking for his defense to succeed. So why bother sticking around to learn a defensive system when you can just transfer somewhere else to play and not have to worry about all of that. He is also really really tough (but fair). Which works as a head coach - since you answer to no one - but as a coordinator you have to make sure the head coach is OK with it. In today's game where players hit the portal if their feelings get hurt, can he be as hard nosed as he wants to be while still keeping players around?\n\nI love him to death but this isn't 2010 anymore (and its why I absolutely hate the current state of college football)",
