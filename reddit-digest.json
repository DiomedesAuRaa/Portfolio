Top Wizards officials Michael Winger and Will Dawkins have searched to anchor their young talent in the next step of the team's development.\n\nThe Hawks are poised to turn the page on a new era with the emergence of Jalen Johnson and others, bringing a much more fluid style of play around their wings and depth. McCollum serves as a valuable plug-and-play veteran while holding a $30.6 million expiring deal.\n\nSource: https://www.espn.com/contributor/shams-charania/b657de7f7ed3f\n\nESPN Story: https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/47545290/sources-hawks-trading-trae-young-wizards-mccollum-kispert",

A lot of travel. And I kind of bounced around to different teams and did stuff with AA and AAA teams too. I did a lot of things people don't see and do a lot of the grunt work, but I love it. \n\nAsk me anything!",

        "selftext": "This latest episode with Goldsberry really made me re-evaluate how I think about Bill's NBA knowledge. He keeps relating things to the Celtics, which makes me think that he isn't watching teams equally. Instead, it feels like he watches the Celtics a ton but probably only watches other teams when it's an interesting matchup or if the team has a player he likes. It's clear that a lot of his NBA takes are primarily given through a blatant Celtics lens, which is really jarring to hear as someone who has been listening for a decent amount of time.\n\nCan any oldheads who have listened to Bill for a longer amount of time (perhaps a week or maybe even a month) weigh in on this? When did he abandon his in-depth analyses in favor of making all these comparisons to Celtics players and analogies to action movies?",

Would he play over Hauser?\"\n* \\#26 Nets: mentions \"the Suns coach\" and says he and Mazzulla are in the running for coach of the year\n* \\#23 Bulls: Kirk actually mentions the Celtics, Bill doesn't continue on that thread, shockingly.\n* \\#22 Mavs: The Mavs should be worried that Cooper Flagg might come to the Celtics in 4 years! His Mom is a huge Celtics fan!\n* \\#20 Trail Blazers: Mentions how well Clingan played against, you guessed it, the Celtics. Then when Goldsberry is mentioning their good wins, Bill mentions again how they beat the Celtics.\n* \\#18 Clippers: Mentions Jaylen Brown's performance against them recently. Later says that Harden did nothing after the Celtics knocked him down in their game.\n* \\#16 Warriors: They're 20th in offense. They need to do what the Celtics are doing, who are 2nd in offense and getting 130-140 points a game. Then later talks about how the Celtics offense works with Queta and Garza setting picks for their guards as opposed to what Horford is giving the Warriors. Then, he goes to the Celtics a **third** time, mentioning how the Warriors don't have a heat check guy like Simons.\n* \\#13 76ers: Mentions rooting against Philly (from a Celtics standpoint)\n* \\#9 Suns: This is the worst one. The Suns are coached like the Celtics (he again does not say the name of the Suns coach). The Suns have a guy in Booker who can go toe to toe with the other team's best player, just like Jaylen Brown on the Celtics. The Suns have a bunch of guys with something to prove, like the Celtics. Bill wants us to know that he isn't comparing these teams by accident.\n* \\#8 Knicks: Kirk mentions the Celtics and Bill gets excited about a rematch in the playoffs. Bill also talks about how the Celtics are a bad matchup for the Knicks.\n* \\#6 Celtics: Bill starts by admitting he's talked about them too much so far, but they still spend 8+ minutes.\n* \\#3 Spurs: Kirk mentions Kornet and Bill talks about how the Celtics miss him. Kirk then asks if the Celtics should make a trade to strengthen their frontcourt.\n* \\#1 Thunder: When talking about OKC's shooting woes, he relates things back to the Celtics-Clippers game he attended.\n\nI know he's a huge homer but this is genuinely the worst I've ever heard from him on what was supposed to be a discussion of the entire league.",
