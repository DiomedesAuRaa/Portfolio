Get the offense fixed, defense would fall apart.  Get the defense fixed the offense would fall apart.\n\n\nUltimately his coaches failed him and he failed his players.\n\n\nSo next year how do you fix this?  Well Dan needs to first decide if he's a play caller or CEO.  If he's a CEO he needs to hire a play caller, someone creative that can own the offense.\n\n\nNext he needs to get Shep some help, a senior defensive assistant that can help so Dan doesn't have to.  Ideally a former HC with 20+ years of coaching, a guy partially retired that can be a sounding board.\n\n\nGet those 2 things figured out and this team will bounce back.",

That's not going to change, we know it and defenses know it. \n\n-Organization miscues, mainly hiring Morton as OC then needing to pull him, not addressing roster needs at the deadline, the weird Ragnow debacle \n\n-Opposing teams now consider the Lions one of the best, so they prepare and play their best. They're no longer the dark horse and teams have been exploiting their weaknesses all season. \n\nPut all of that in a blender and we get the 2025 season.

Someone made a post about it a day ago, but they transitioned to a passing offense relying on deeper routes/ more 7 step drops than last year. It seems odd to do this when you are also breaking in a new center.\n\n3. The Ragnow “un-retirement ” and how it went down. I think the team was expecting him to just come back in 2025, and Rags felt bad going back on his word so he tried to flip the switch when he saw them struggling. He likely gets hurt ramping up which is how the hamstring issue happened.\n\nMy guess is at some point after the 2024 season  Ragnow had changed his mind but the wheels were already in motion - draft and FA had happened so team had to deal with what they had.\n\nI also think Ragnow has been 50/50 on coming back in 2026, but if my theory is true the team will prepare as if they don’t expect him back, meaning either Rat at C or a notable free agent pickup (it’s incredibly rare for a rookie to start at Center so I don’t see that either).",
