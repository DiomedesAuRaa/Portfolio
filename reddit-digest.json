I've watched quite a few matches and I love it.\n\nTo deepen my understanding, could someone explain in detail how a French football season works? (signing, transfer approval, regular season, playoffs, Heisman Trophy…)\n\nI'd also like to know how players balance their professional and personal lives (classes, transfer approval, etc.).\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nedit 1: Thank you for all your initial messages, I've already learned a lot of new things, I love the community.\n\nFYI:\n\nMy favorite team: UMIAMI (I love the city, it was a natural fit; I followed the whole season and knew I'd made the right choice after crying tears of joy following their win against A&M)\n\nFavorite player: Johnny Manziel. I've watched all his highlights, interviews, and game replays. I love his vibe; it's a shame he didn't make it in the NFL.\n\nFavorite game: I've watched a few classics, but for now, it's still the 2013 Iron Bowl. Chris Davis's comeback kick made me discover and fall in love with the CFB. (If you have any other games to suggest, feel free, preferably old school ones)",

The fbs is made up of 134(?) teams, which are further subdivided into conferences. 5 lesser conferences called the group of 5 (soon to be group of 6) and power 4.

        "selftext": "The sub has continued to grow over the past year and we now routinely can get ~60 posts per hour during our peaks.  But with that growth, it gets harder and harder to find what you are looking for as well.  So listening to the feedback from the sub, we have decided to institute a new rule for the subreddit starting next week.  \n\n**Starting on Monday, February 9th, there will be a limit of 3 (three) new posts per user per day.  Any new posts after that limit will be removed.**\n\nThere will be some exceptions made so it is not an automatic 3 strikes and you are out.\n\n* Any links to RINGER-related podcasts will be not be counted against your daily posts.\n* If there is confirmed breaking news (not rumors), direct links to the story will not be counted either.  \n* If you create a post but to decide to delete it on your own, it will not be counted against you. (EDIT:  This would be a for short window after the post is originally made (1 hour, maybe 2), not constantly rotating new posts all day long so you always have a new post made)\n* Days such as the other day with Russillo's IG hack, we would likely suspend the rule for a day to allow everyone to have their fun.  \n\nSince this is a new rule, if you have questions, feel free to ask us about it.  If you think of ways to improve it, let us know.  As always we are open to feedback.  \n\nViolations of the new rule will be the same as breaking the other rules (but hopefully it doesn't get to that point).  Honest mistakes will be treated with understanding but repeated/purposeful violations have a short lease.",
