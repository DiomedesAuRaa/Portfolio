        "selftext": "[This season](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/s/51pSmGZcU1), Mendoza threw for 41 TD’s, for an average of about 2.56 per game. If you adjust this average to just 2 per game, he goes from 41 TD’s to 32 across his 16-game season. I’ll be generous and give him 35.\n\nNow let’s adjust his passer rating. **It goes from 182.9 to 177.69 just from adjusting his touchdowns to slightly above 2 per game. Later on, I will adjust further to take yards into account.**\n\nNext, we have to account for his passing yards per attempt being higher than average. He has an average of a flukey 9.3 yards per attempt this season. If we adjust this to 8 ypa, which is still 0.9 yards higher than the mean, he goes from have 3,535 passing yards to just 3,032 passing yards on the season.\n\nNow, I will adjust his passer rating again based on these newly adjusted stats.\n\nAfter this, his passer rating ends up at 166.54.\n\nHis final 16-games adjusted stats:\n\n• **3,032 yards / 379 attempts / 273 completions / 72% completion (same) / 35 touchdowns / 6 INT (same) / 8 Y/A / 166.54 rate**\n\n# What does this tell us?\n\nIt tells us that Mendoza’s perceived success in college is largely inflated by unsustainable, wildly outlier stats in his 16 games as perceived elite talent. When you adjust by bringing down his outlier stats, he heavily regresses to a slightly above average college QB.",

        "selftext": "Hello reddit,\n\n \n\nIm writing this post about the NBA “star player”, Allen Iverson. \n\nOn the 22nd of January 2026, Alllen iverson came to Cavalo Prestige Melbourne to meet 12 kids who are battling cancer. \n\nThe experience was organised by Challenge - Supporting kids with cancer, and Allen Iversons management team. \n\nMy little brother who is 12 years old and is currently receiving chemotherapy for ALCL lymphoma, was so excited to meet one of his idols.\n\nHe came out to be extremely disgusted and disappointed in Allen Iversons behaviour, and so were the other familys. \n\nFirstly, we were all told we would get to sit with him from 10:45-11:30am, and that did not happen. \n\nHe was in the podcast room until about 12:30pm and did not come out and apologise, instead his security did. \n\nWe were waiting in a downstairs room with his security with all of the kids, and his security told us he was “having a bad day” and didnt want to come out. \n\nShortly after, we were told to go upstairs to meet him, and we did not get to meet him. \n\nHe refused to allow parents in the room with him, which quite frankly is weird. \n\nOnce we were directed upstairs, we were escorted to the side of the room while he was doing a news interview. \n\nWe went into the day being told we were going to get balls/jerseys and anything else we wanted signed and to think of questions we wanted to ask him. That did not happen.\n\nAfter we waited hours, his security firmly told us he is not signing anything at all, and we did not get to talk to him at all, he did not say a word to anyone. \n\nWe were lined up and all the kids got was a photo, and he did not seem impressed about that. \n\nHe had his hands in his pockets and did not smile or put his arm around any kids in any photos. \n\nHe knew the kids were sick, and still did not put any effort or acknowledgement to that. \n\nEveryone was so disgusted in his behaviour, it was honestly so disappointing. \n\nOne of the familys drove 6 and a half hours to meet him, and the kids where so extremely sad in the end. He seemed to think he was better than everyone else, and it was obvious he did not want to have anything to do with a group of sick kids. \n\nAs parents and siblings of children with life threatening diseases, we are deeply disappointed in Allen Iversons actions and he needs to do better.",

So in this instance Arsenal basically surround the oppositions goalkeeper on corners, the goalkeeper struggles to win any balls in the air, punches, catches etc. Arsenal have a tall team so it causes chaos. its been wildly successful leadjng to people saying they rely on set piece goals rather than open play. They are currently  4 points clear at the top of the Premier League and 1st place in the champions league standings.\n\nThe parking the bus strategy we've been seeing in overload (again another term derived from football) is another example of Haramball. Teams would show up, put 10 men behind the ball, camped on their own box and invite the other team to try and break them down. Games would often end in 0-0s or 1-0 for the parking team who'd score on the counter attack late on etc. The term came from Jose Mourinho years ago describing the play style as \"they brought the team bus and parked it infront of the goal\"",

        "selftext": "Rivalry week for the men’s and women’s basketball teams, men go to Breslin on a Friday and women go Sunday, both will be top 15 ranked matchups. Has me reflecting on this rivalry. I grew up in the Lansing area so I was always surrounded by the rivalry - everyone I knew had some connection to MSU. My parents went to MSU, though my mom did grad at umich when I was young so I always supported Michigan and ended up going to Michigan. I noticed pretty quickly a lot of my out of state friends didn’t really view the rivalry the same at all which is understandable. Obviously it’s MSU’s main rivalry so growing up around MSU it felt all encompassing. The rivalry used to be fun, I mean it was tense and there was plenty of shit talking and all that but it was fun. Seemed to really shift around the late 2010s, the Devin Bush stomping was a big flash point  and culminated to the point of no return with the tunnel jumping. Now it’s so divisive and toxic I hardly enjoy it anymore. Feels like fans have lost the plot a bit and they have real life hatred towards each other. I know every school has a segment of crazed fans but you’d think Michigan personally harmed a lot of Spartan fans, they legit hate Michigan more than they love their own team. \n\nTLDR- what are your thoughts on the Michigan/ MSU rivalry? Feels really toxic which drains a lot of the fun out of it for me. ",

They still have the East’s best record (8-3) in January and their coaching staff is going to L.A. for the All-Star Game(s).\n\nThree takeaways\n\nLike most of the league, the Pistons have had some offensive issues of late. Prior to Sunday, they had a six-game stretch where they scored just 106.1 points per 100 possessions, with turnovers a recurring issue. Cade Cunningham missed two of those games and shot 18-for-60 (30%) in the other four.\n\nBut the Pistons got to play the Kings on Sunday afternoon, and they had their most efficient offensive performance of the season, scoring 139 points on 100 possessions. Cunningham led eight Pistons in double-figures with 29 points on 13-for-22 shooting. He’s shot worse both in the paint and from 3-point range than he did last season, but his overall efficiency (true shooting percentage) is down just a tick, because his free throw rate (35.9 attempts per 100 shots from the field) is the highest of his career by a wide margin.\n\nDespite the loss to Houston on Friday, the Pistons still have the best record (14-6) in games played between the 17 teams that are currently over .500. Of course, their visit to Denver on Tuesday will be their first game against one of the top three teams in the West.\n\nComing up: The Pistons have spent most of January at home, but they’ll close the month with their final three games in the Mountain or Pacific time zones. They’re an impressive 5-0 in rest-disadvantage games and will be at a disadvantage at Golden State on Friday.\n\nWeek 15: @ DEN, @ PHX, @ GSW, vs. BKN",
