TMZ Sports has learned that the person behind the mask has lawyered up -- and has selected the attorney that represented Sofia Jamora in her domestic violence lawsuit against Hayes.\n\nWaukeenMcCoy told us that he is now representing the person Hayes decked when the Lakers were in town for a showdown with Washington on January 30.\n\n\"We will give them the opportunity to resolve the matter before taking legal action,\" McCoy said. \"But legal action is anticipated.\"\n\nHe also said other parties could be involved.\n\nWhen asked about any injuries the person sustained ... McCoy said, \"All I want to say at the moment is that he was injured.\"\n\nAs you know, Hayes was suspended for one game by the NBA after the incident. He served that suspension during the Lakers' game against the Philadelphia 76ers last week at Crypto.com Arena.",

Even if you use said AI chatbots or betting sites and might even be interested to learn more about new offerings from those companies, did any of that actually speak to you? \n\nAnd for lots of folks, particularly older folks who have no engagement with these products whatsoever, was there even an attempt at humor or cleverness to attract new potential customers? Did any one of these companies actually try to engage people's brains or sense of creativity?\n\nI recall not too long ago when most commercials were for actual physical products or locations, i.e. car companies, department stores, clothing and shoes, hardware stores, lawn care, and physical electronics such as phones, tablets, computers, headphones, etc. Even the non-tangible products, such as insurance, cell service providers, mortgage lenders, etc. resonated with consumers in a simple way: they insure my car or home, they allow me to speak on the phone with my friends, they lend money for me to buy a house, start a business, buy my teenager their first car, etc.\n\nWith this new style of ad, it's almost like these companies view consumers' agency and intelligence as roadblocks to growing their revenue streams. They are no longer people to be marketed to; they are a monthly subscription payment with a human attached.",
