I know why college is messed up, (no central authority) but it’s still the reality that it’s in need of a predictable pattern. \n\nThe flow of watching games every weekend is never broken with the NFL with the exception of the bye week before the Super Bowl, which obviously makes sense. With college I’ll be in the flow of watching games every week and then after conference championships it gets weird and it’s easy to forget about the narratives or the small things since I also follow the NFL.",

Its been reported the Mets offer for Tucker was in the same ballpark as LA's, but if the money is even, why not go play where you can win a ring in nice weather and hang out with movie stars?

Colt said that it was a tipping point where lqgend wasn’t having fun and with the constant changing of “coaches” coming in and voicing their opinions it was too much in that environment for him to actually learn and improve.\n\nThat entire Attach conversation is a pretty fair and balanced conversation, Colt explained his issues from his perspective, took ownership of his own mistakes and admitted in the end it didn’t make sense for him to be wasting their time on another run with him knowing he would be going to ranked play within 3-5 weeks. \n\nAgain, maybe I’m missing further context of things said, but Colt wasn’t slandering anyone in that conversation. He had frustrations and admitted that there were fair frustrations they had towards him. This just seems wildly over dramatic for content purposes",
