I've watched quite a few matches and I love it.\n\nTo deepen my understanding, could someone explain in detail how a French football season works? (signing, transfer approval, regular season, playoffs, Heisman Trophy…)\n\nI'd also like to know how players balance their professional and personal lives (classes, transfer approval, etc.).\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nedit 1: Thank you for all your initial messages, I've already learned a lot of new things, I love the community.\n\nFYI:\n\nMy favorite team: UMIAMI (I love the city, it was a natural fit; I followed the whole season and knew I'd made the right choice after crying tears of joy following their win against A&M)\n\nFavorite player: Johnny Manziel. I've watched all his highlights, interviews, and game replays. I love his vibe; it's a shame he didn't make it in the NFL.\n\nFavorite game: I've watched a few classics, but for now, it's still the 2013 Iron Bowl. Chris Davis's comeback kick made me discover and fall in love with the CFB. (If you have any other games to suggest, feel free, preferably old school ones)",
