Oregon State and Washington State will each receive around $3.6 million as part of an addendum signed later. Those conference percentages were based on previous CFP appearances among member schools in each conference.\n\nThere also will no longer be performance bonuses for advancing in the field for most teams. Miami earned around $20 million for its run this season. Next year, it will be a flat number. The team at the bottom of the SEC or Big Ten standings will earn more than the top teams from other conferences that make the field. That financial layout was one point of Florida State’s lawsuit against the ACC.\n\nNotre Dame will receive more than $12 million annually, with a $6 million boost for making the field, putting its payout near the Big Ten/SEC levels in those years it earns an invite.\"",

My grandma's favorite Greek restaurant is on that street. It's all very close. Seeing that happen definitely takes you back. You never want to see anything like that happen. I definitely think we're too advanced as a species, just plain and simple, for things like that to be happening. No matter what your opinions are or what your beliefs are, you should be able to agree that nobody needs to be dying on the street. I wasn't there. I don't have a full picture of everything going on. I can't really speak on the details and what happened and what transpired. I just feel for the families of anybody who's lost their life up there. I'm wishing safety for everybody.\"",

When you’ve got Jalen Duren and Isaiah Stewart ahead of you, it’s easy to get lost in the rotation — but every time Reed gets minutes, he makes himself impossible to ignore.\n\nYou can honestly talk yourself into him being more than an energy big. He could start and not look out of place.\n\nHe’s not pretty. He’s not smooth.\n\nBut he does the dirty schnitzel. \n\nAlso, let’s be real — he should be like an 80 overall in 2K.\n\nBro is all Detroit. ",

        "selftext": "I wanna preface this post by saying that obviously a lot of things had to go our way in order for us to win last night. I dont think we'll ever see Murray miss on back to back free throw appearances in the clutch like that again. But for those who watched the game, I want to bring you back to the fourth quarter with about 1:45 left. Murray throws up a middy and it clanks off the rim. Duren happens to be out of position in the post, so Jonas Valanciunas has a great opportunity to clean things up for them, like he had been doing all game. Then Cade comes out of nowhere, leaps out of his shoes, and snags the board over Jonas. Its a critical moment because we were only up by four at this point. Cade quickly pushes it to Duncan, and Duncan hits Harris for an easy 2. We go up six and Nuggets call timeout. To go up against one of the strongest guys in the league, out-fight him for possession and then basically turn it into a fast break is just insane work. And he does little stuff like this every game. We are blessed to have a big guard who knows how to utilize his size and toughness. I love this guy and I love this team! Thats all! Go Pistons!",
