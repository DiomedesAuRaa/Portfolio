Entered the playoffs cold and lost in the Wild Card round.\n\n• **2024 Pittsburgh Steelers**  \nFinished 10-7 but dropped their last four games. Several outlets noted they were only the third team in NFL history to enter the playoffs on a four-game losing streak.\n\n• **1986 New York Jets** (a little different but worth mentioning)  \nThey lost five straight to end the season, still made the playoffs, and actually won their Wild Card game before losing the next round.\n\nSo if the Packers lose this Vikings game and head into the playoffs on a four-game skid, they would be joining a list that is basically two teams long, or three if you include the Jets with the longer streak.",

        "selftext": "I know it’s early and lots of dominos left to fall - finalizing of the staff, the portal action and hanging on to recruits but I wonder if people are being realistic about next season. I’m hearing fans and media say the expectation is the playoff but have you looked at that schedule next year? They could easily have a better team and win less games than this year. The schedule this year was a dream, basically 3 tough games. Next year they’ve got Oklahoma, Indiana, Penn State, @ Oregon, @ Ohio State. Even Iowa and @ Minnesota are tricky. Regardless of where you fall on the coaching hire, seems like expectations need to be tempered.  I think 8-9 wins is where I’d predict and that likely doesn’t get you in. ",

Probably even better would be to do 12 teams, and have a round before the quarterfinals to play into the bowl games.  Then all of those bowl games still matter and you have plenty of room for any undefeated team to make it even with an injury to their quarterback.  Maybe even guarantee a spot to a non-Power 4 team so cincy could get in.   Probably would have people complaining about the selection of teams 9-12 when weighing head-to-head vs. bad losses, etc. Conference title games are harder to make as important as they would have been before, but they mattered to Clemson and they determine the seeding / bye, so seems they just mean less to fans/media than the teams.",
