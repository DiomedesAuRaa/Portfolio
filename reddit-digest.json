I’m sure, but we have the facilities that most of our competition doesn’t have.

How we manage it will be key!  \n\nBottom-Line - most of us have been through this before and We Are always coming out of these changes for the better!\n\nLet’s give MC and PK their shot and time.  4yrs is what we should allow for the development of their way of becoming an elite program - not just a top 15 team year in and out but a top 10 Team year in year out.

No. \n\n* CREAM seems to be in effect: I’m genuinely excited about the staff Whitt has assembled and I think if the money is equal we have a chance to retain any player in the portal… but the money won’t be equal.
