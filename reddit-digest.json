The team blocked an interview request from the Dolphins, who were interested in Gradkowski as a potential quarterbacks coach,* [*according to NFL insider Jordan Schultz*](https://x.com/Schultz_Report/status/2022103478126956997?s=20)*. The former NFL quarterback and XFL offensive coordinator only arrived in Detroit last offseason, but he quickly became invaluable to the team’s operation after* ***Ben Johnson****‘s departure.*\n\n*Had the Dolphins hired Gradkowski, he would have been tasked with identifying and working with Miami’s next starting quarterback, as* [*the team is expected to part ways*](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2026/02/dolphins-hope-to-trade-qb-tua-tagovailoa) *with* [***Tua Tagovailoa***](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TagoTu00.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2026-02-12_pfr) *this offseason.

Gradkowski will likely play a key role in the Lions’ transition to new offensive coordinator* ***Drew Petzing****.*\n\n*The Lions will not be able to block Gradkowski from future coordinator interview requests, and the club’s desire to keep him suggests that they believe he is heading in that direction. He has not been a coach for very long, but he led the XFL’s St. Louis Battlehawks to strong finishes as their offensive coordinator in 2023 and 2024. That play-calling success could be an attractive asset to other teams in future hiring cycles.*\n\n",
