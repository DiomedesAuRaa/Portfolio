        "selftext": ">Redick -- who has remained an advocate behind the scenes, sources close to Ayton told ESPN -- took the feedback in stride. In a rematch with Memphis two nights later, Redick called the first play for Ayton and the early score spurred him to 15 points, eight rebounds and three blocks for the game.\n\n>\"It's a tale as old as time for a big guy,\" Redick said. \"That's the reality of being a big: Someone has to pass you the ball. You're not initiating the offense.\"\n\n>There's also an ego that is needed to thrive on the NBA stage. Similar to James' \"CHOSEN 1\" tattoo that spans from shoulder to shoulder, Ayton has \"DOMINAYTON\" inked in jagged capital letters across his upper back.\n\n>The Lakers have stoked that ego, too: Rob Pelinka, team president of basketball operations and general manager, commissioned a black T-shirt with a gold screen print depicting half of a lion's face and half of Ayton's face that he presented to the 27-year-old. Members of the training staff wrap Ayton's water bottle in athletic tape and write \"DA's Crunk Juice -- Drink this to unleash the beast\" in black marker on it before games.\n\n>The task for the Lakers is getting Ayton to care as much for the grind and the role as he does for putting points on the board.\n\n>\"When he's at his best, and we've seen it, we've seen glimpses of it, he's playing with force,\" a team source told ESPN. \"And that's playing with great force on both ends of the floor when it comes to screening. Then rolling and putting pressure on the rim; \\[when the\\] shot goes up, crashing the glass; sprinting back in transition; loading to the basketball; calling out your communication; being in the right positioning; contesting shots; boxing out. Those things for a big are just really thankless when you're a skilled big. But on this team, that's what his role is.\n\n>\"He has to be a dirt worker.\"\n\nSource: [https://www.espn.com.sg/nba/story/\\_/id/48034239/los-angeles-lakers-deandre-ayton-future-contract-lebron-james-luka-doncic-2026-playoffs](https://www.espn.com.sg/nba/story/_/id/48034239/los-angeles-lakers-deandre-ayton-future-contract-lebron-james-luka-doncic-2026-playoffs)",

Applying those midpoints against Cot's Contracts estimates of 2026 CB tax payroll, I find that total payroll would decrease from $6.12B to $6.07B, or by 1%. That is well within the margin of error for both Cot's estimates and whatever cap and floor is actually proposed: a cap and floor of, say, $155M and $275M would instead be *marginally* payroll accretive.",

You add that to the $412 million and it turns into $602.8 million shed versus $347 million added.  \n\nThere's also the issue that this is the proposal for 2027 and you're using 2025 payroll numbers.

It just doesn't feel natural when listening, its hard to pinpoint exactly... \n\nLike I care way less about Bill making wild or even off-base claims or takes because it just feels like a natural random convo he's having with a buddy, and his ability to do that draws out more natural and interesting reactions from his guests which elevates the pod overall, whereas other podcasters just feel like they're making points based on agreed upon outline that they came up with in a pre production meeting.

He can effortlessly draw really niche comparisons for certain team archetypes, player archetypes, and other situational elements of sports. And on top of that, he’ll also mix in some incredibly precise pop culture references to blend into his sports content too. \n\n\nTruly the podfather.",
