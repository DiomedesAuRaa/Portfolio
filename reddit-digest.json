This season, I say we make some noise and push Isaiah Stewart to be in the 6MOTY conversation.\n\nThe idea came to me when Stew won Eastern Conerence Defensive Player of the Month despite playing off the bench and earning just over 20 mins a game. I know that 6MOTY is almost always rewarded to subs who bring instant offensive firepower. But the prominent names in the sixth man talk right now are not really running away with it. Ajay Mitchell, Naz Reid, and Keldon Johnson are averaging just 3 to 4 ppg more than Stew. NAW's name comes up in some lists, but he has more games as a starter than a sub so he should not be considered.\n\nStew has bigger impact as a sub even if his contribution offensively is not huge. Which of the other 6MOTY candidates serve as a symbol of the identity of their teams? Cade of course is the face of our franchise, but the Pistons are currently leading the East because they are the 2nd best defensive team in the league and Stewart is the face of our defense.\n\nISAIAH STEWART FOR NBA SIXTH MAN OF THE YEAR!\n\n",

Every team starts the first 8 games with their QB. Then, every team has their bye week in week 9. This is when QBs would switch. They would go into a lottery and each team from draw a name for their QB for the rest of the regular season. They would have a week and a half to learn a new playbook, team, and coaching staff. \nWhen the playoffs come along, all playoff contenders would switch again. \n\nImagine the absolute chaos. A few senecios that could happen:\n-  You’re 7-1 with Drake Maye, only to make the wildcard at 10-6 with Bryce Young. And you have half a week to get ready with Joe Burrow. \n-  You get lucky with having Mahomes and Prescott finishing with the 1 or 2 seed only to have JJ McCarthy in the playoffs\n-  You start off 2-6 with Justin Fields only to get a healthy Lamar and squeak out the division and end up with Sam Darnold. \nAll QBs would be payed by league and would not count against the salary cap, unless they’re injured. League doctors would have to say they are injured to avoid any tampering. \nTeams would have to build out solid rosters and be prepared to win with average to mediocre QBs. \nWe would no longer debate if you gave QB A the team of QB B, they would be great. Now we know who the best quarterback is, because they truly win everywhere. ",
