Entered the playoffs cold and lost in the Wild Card round.\n\n• **2024 Pittsburgh Steelers**  \nFinished 10-7 but dropped their last four games. Several outlets noted they were only the third team in NFL history to enter the playoffs on a four-game losing streak.\n\n• **1986 New York Jets** (a little different but worth mentioning)  \nThey lost five straight to end the season, still made the playoffs, and actually won their Wild Card game before losing the next round.\n\nSo if the Packers lose this Vikings game and head into the playoffs on a four-game skid, they would be joining a list that is basically two teams long, or three if you include the Jets with the longer streak.",

Looked very confident out there. \n\nRon holland got that dog in him. Loved the sequence when Luka hit a step back 3 on him then coming back down he hit one. He took it personal. Looked like he did the same celebration luka did a littler later after an and 1. \n\nThe scrappiness and athleticism of this team as a whole is just so apparent in person. \n\nJavonte Green had a quietly good night.
