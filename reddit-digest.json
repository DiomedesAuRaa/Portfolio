He also won a World Championship in 2024.\n\nSince leaving OpTic and joining Falcons, though, it feels like the community has completely moved on. Players like Simp, Shotzzy, aBeZy, HyDra, Huke, etc. are now ranked above him with little debate.\n\nWas this due to role, team situation, meta changes, or just recency bias?
