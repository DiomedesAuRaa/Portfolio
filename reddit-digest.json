Green Bay is already in, Minnesota is out, and the Packers are currently underdogs with a lot of people expecting them to rest starters or at least not push key guys.\n\nThat got me wondering how often this has actually happened before.\n\nFrom what I can find, it is extremely rare:\n\n• **1999 Detroit Lions**  \nThey lost their final four regular season games. Entered the playoffs cold and lost in the Wild Card round.\n\n• **2024 Pittsburgh Steelers**  \nFinished 10-7 but dropped their last four games. Several outlets noted they were only the third team in NFL history to enter the playoffs on a four-game losing streak.\n\n• **1986 New York Jets** (a little different but worth mentioning)  \nThey lost five straight to end the season, still made the playoffs, and actually won their Wild Card game before losing the next round.\n\nSo if the Packers lose this Vikings game and head into the playoffs on a four-game skid, they would be joining a list that is basically two teams long, or three if you include the Jets with the longer streak.",

He comes in, spaces the floor, pressures the ball, and doesn’t need the offense run for him to contribute.\n\nWhat really stands out is how natural he looks in the role.

She even has a sleeve of Tattoos (very well done). She couldn't believe someone could do a list of anything without including LOTR but I didn't really have a good answer when she asked me why he hates it so much. Any ideas? It would be nice if they would do rewatchables about anyone of them.Bill doesn't have to be there. I can't believe out of everyone that comes on that no one likes it. ",
