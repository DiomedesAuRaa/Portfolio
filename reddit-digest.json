        "selftext": "I have always wondered why F1 was so dead set against moveable aerodynamic devices for so long, and today I ran across an explanation. \n\nThe origin was in 1970. Aero was really coming in, and the Lotus 49 was using a rear wing raised way up high, on these spindly supports (think kind of like a Top Fuel dragster). And the supports were attached to the suspension, instead of the body, so the wing would actually move around.  \n\nDuring a race, one of them broke off Jochen Rindt's car, and he crashed. The setup was blamed, and thereafter, the rule was changed so wings had to be attached to the body. (It didn't help that Colin Chapman had a reputation for building cars so light that they posed a hazard to his drivers.)\n\nI'm sure some people already know this, but it was new to me, so I thought I'd post.
