        "selftext": "During this lull between Christmas and New Year's, I got to thinking about the \"Shakey's game\" (which I have always understood to be the first Wild Card game on Saturday). I wondered what the furthest any team to play in a Shakey's game has ever gotten in the playoffs.\n\nBecause I have far too much free time on my hands, I decided to look at every Shakey's game since the 2000-01 playoffs to find out exactly that. I also found a bunch of other interesting trivia (to sports nerds and sports nerds only) that I thought I should share here.\n\nSince 2000:\n\n\\- 1 Shakey's game participant has won the Super Bowl (2006 Colts)\n\n\\- 2 participants have made it to the Super Bowl but lost (2008 Cardinals, 2021 Bengals)\n\n\\- 4 participants made it to a Conference Championship Game but lost (2001 Eagles, 2009 Jets, 2020 Bills, 2022 49ers)\n\n\\- The other 18 Shakey's game winners immediately flamed out in the Divisional round\n\n\\- The Houston Texans (unsurprisingly) own the Shakey's game, having appeared in it \\*literally\\* every time they've made the playoffs -- 8 appearances with a 6-2 record. Though it seems they'll be spared this year by either Carolina or Tampa Bay.\n\n\\- The Shakey's game is played more often between AFC teams (17 times) than NFC teams (7 times) which probably says something about who the NFL thinks the most interesting teams are. Between 2015 and 2021, the Shakey's game featured only AFC teams.\n\n\\- Andy Reid's Chiefs playoff debut was in a Shakey's game -- a game in which the Chiefs were on the losing end of the second biggest comeback in NFL playoff history\n\n\\- The \"Beast Quake\" game was a Shakey's game\n\n\\- Josh Allen, Joe Burrow, and Brock Purdy each got their first playoff win in a Shakey's game\n\n\\- And until recently, Philip Rivers' final game was a Shakey's game\n\n\\- The last time the Dolphins won a playoff game was a Shakey's game\n\n\\- There have been 2 Shakey's shutouts (2002 Jets beat Colts 41-0, 2015 Chiefs beat Texans 30-0)\n\n\\- Only one Shakey's game has gone to overtime (2019 Texans beat Bills 22-19)\n\nSorry if that was a lot. I had just compiled all this information and felt I needed to unload it somehow without sounding like a deranged person to my friends and family.",

If you start the disaster of show endings with Lost and its self indulgent final season where they let them be happy off the island only for that to be the waiting area before moving on was terribly weak and wasn’t a fufilling ending and they didn’t bother to try to explain everything\n\nOr if you look at GOT which Martin painted an impossible to unwind mystery box and left brief notes to the directors on how it was supposed to end.  There is a reason Martin hasn’t finished his books.  He saw his ending on TV and it failed\n\nOr the failure of JJ Abrams to have any ideas on how the mystery box was supposed to unwind that he built in TFA and then completely ignoring the last Jedi happened for the rise of sky walker.\n\nAmongst a history of failure of unwinding the mystery box the Duffer Brothers did an amazing job.  They nailed the feeling of the ending, they nailed each character in the end, and they nailed the wrap up of the lore.  It’s rare to see as satisfying of conclusion of this style of show.\n\nThey handled Vecna perfectly with Henry always being evil when he bashed the face in of that guy before being infected and he owns his evil and dies with it.\n\nEleven being left in Limbo is perfect for both sequel setting and to the spirit of the show being about the stories we tell about ourselves.\n\nNancy choosing Nancy, Johnathon choosing John and Steve choosing Steve is the best ending to a love triangle in a long time.  Them drinking on the roof felt like a perfect ending for them\n\nThe do some decent recovery with Will and Mike after fumbling the coming out scene.\n\nMike in his final scene with Hopper discussing how you have to choose how you want to live and respect others choices is a good ending for his struggle with his demons.\n\nI liked the D&D scene at the end positing what happens with each of them including providing a possible alternate history where El lives but not telling us.\n\nLore wise the worm hole, the Mind flayer and One, the upside down all work really cleanly. My only complaint is how gravity works in the upside down.  Once you hit the middle between earth and the abyss gravity should be opposite and you should be sucked “up” towards the abyss.  But that’s minor.\n\nThe finale felt right.  It also sets us up for a sequel 10 years from now with Steve’s kids in Hawkings and Steve being clueless about what’s going on.\n\nI’m not sure what more people wanted from the end.",
