        "selftext": "Basically guys who are starting but have a diminished or unnatural role, or bench guys who should be starting somewhere.  I’ll give my top 3 \n\n1. Anthony black: I will never get off this hill and I’ve known it since day 1, he \\*will\\* be an all star some day whether it be in Orlando or elsewhere(I’ve been begging for the Celtics to trade for him for years).  I’m just in love with his feel for the game paired with his defensive/passing instincts and ability to stay under control.  The shooting will continue to improve and he would be the PERFECT combo guard starting next to a curry/dame/trae/white/garland type player \n\n2. Kuminga: I truly don’t care what anyone says I genuinely just think Kerr is the most stubborn coach in the league and is ruining this guy.  Reminds me a ton of young Jaylen, has all the tools and ability in the world just needs to be empowered.  Will thrive somewhere where he canstep into a 2nd/3rd option role right away(Chicago/washington/sacramento/philly).  \n\n3. Jaylin Williams: annoys me to no end that the thunder are fully aware of this but they hoard him despite that because they can.  This dude would be such a perfect Celtics center I swear to god, I just tend to buy stock in these high feel shooting bigs who defend with their brains and he fits that mold.  I think he could be a starting level big somewhere else. \n\nHonorable mention- Derek lively: doesn’t make the list because injuries have robbed him of his career lately but when healthy I still think Dallas is a bad fit for him now, he really should be the short roll/defensive anchor next to a high volume playmaker/scorer(like Luka) because that’s where he thrives.  He’s an incredible connector on both ends and truly raises the ceiling of a good offense and good defense, thrives off of someone who can do the pick and roll dance. Probably won’t ever come to fruition because of health but he’s one of my favorite players in recent history \n\nWho are your picks? ",

Hausmann says he still intends to finish his degree at U-M.\n\n\"From Uganda to America, with a full heart, I’m officially medically retiring from football. This game has shaped me, but now it’s time to focus on my true purpose on this earth full time. I’ll be finishing my degree at the University of Michigan. Thank you to everyone who has supported me on this journey the best is still ahead.\"\n\nIn early December, Hausmann explained that he departed the program and the country after an unfortunate experience with U-M staff member.\n\n\"This is why I left America,\" wrote Hausmann. \"You tell one staff member about an experience I had with my faith. An experience where I was trying to figure out what was going on, still knowing I was in season. So I thought it would be smart to talk to someone. So I go to the building where I spend most of my calendar year, the football facility. I thought I would receive guidance and clarity, as it was a life-changing experience. After hearing what I had to say, I got put in the category of a mental patient who is going to end their life. If anyone has a clue who I was, they know that’s the last thing I would ever do.\"\n\n#GoBlue",
