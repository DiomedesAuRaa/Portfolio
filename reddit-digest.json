        "selftext": "Source:   [ https://pr.nba.com ](https://pr.nba.com)\n\nNEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2026 - The NBA announced today that it has fined two teams related to the management of their rosters for recent games.\n\nThe Utah Jazz organization has been fined $500,000 for conduct detrimental to the league related to the team's games against the Orlando Magic on Feb. 7 and the Miami Heat on Feb. 9. During those games, the Jazz removed two of the team's top players, Lauri Markkanen and Jaren Jackson, Jr., before the beginning of the fourth quarter and did not return them to the game, even though these players were otherwise able to continue to play and the outcomes of the games were thereafter in doubt.\n\nIn addition, the Indiana Pacers have been fined $100,000 for violating the Player Participation Policy in connection with the team's game against the Utah Jazz on Feb. 3. Following an investigation, including review by an independent physician, the NBA determined that Pascal Siakam, a star player under the Policy, and two other Pacers starters, neither of whom participated in the game, could have played under the medical standard in the Policy, including by playing reduced minutes. Alternatively, the team could have held the players out of other games in a way that would have better promoted compliance with the Policy.\n\n# \"Overt behavior like this that prioritizes draft position over winning undermines the foundation of NBA competition and we will respond accordingly to any further actions that compromise the integrity of our games,\" said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. \"Additionally, we are working with our Competition Committee and Board of Governors to implement further measures to root out this type of conduct.\"",

I was fortunate to meet him.”\n\n\"I think he made a statement and afterwards apologised. I will not comment on what Sir Jim Ratcliffe said because after that - all around the world it is a problem that we have - all around the countries.”\n\n\"We treat immigrant people and other people that come from other countries - that is a problem that our countries have. It is a big big big problem because the fact that I am Catalan and you are British - what influence we had when we were born was mum and dad, right? That's why we were born there.”\n\n\"Everybody wants to have a better life. Every person wants to have a perspective to have a better future for themselves, for their families or their friends. Sometimes opportunities come in the place that you were born and the place that you go. Today before it was so difficult to travel but today in one hour you can be everywhere.”\n\n\"That is why the place you were born doesn't make a difference. The moment we start, we have a lot of work to do about that. Does it make me feel like I am better than you because I am Catalan? No.”\n\n\"My education when I was born, when I travel in Mexico, live in Qatar, live in Italy, live in England or Germany - that is just the benefit of my personality and how I grew up. I met incredible nice people travelling and that is what it is about but don't make me feel bad just for the fact I was born in one place and different from the other.”\n\n\"Most people run away from their countries for the problems that are in their country, not because they want to leave.”\n\n\"The more we embrace other cultures, truly embrace it, then we will have a better society - I do not have any doubts about that.\"",
