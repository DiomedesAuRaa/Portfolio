It communicates the intensity of these cars much better than the high-fidelity stabilised cameras, even if it’s objectively “worse”.\n\nAlthough looking at other clips it seems like they might have had two cameras for each car?

        "selftext": "Oliver Glasner has conceded that Marc Guéhi will leave Crystal Palace for Manchester City this month for the right price.\n\nCity are considering a move for Guéhi, the 25-year-old England centre back, after their defence was weakened by injuries to Josko Gvardiol and Rúben Dias last weekend. Guéhi, whose Palace contract ends this summer, has also been linked with Liverpool, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.\n\nGlasner said last month that he expected Guéhi to stay at Palace until the end of this season, but admitted on Tuesday that he could leave in the January window.  \n\n“If a player feels too good for a club, it is better to sell him, and if a player is not good enough for a club, you also have to sell him,” Glasner said. “To get the best out of your squad, it must be a match.”\n\nAsked whether Guéhi and City are a potential “match” in January, Glasner said: “It could be. I’m not so naive as not to know that if a massive offer comes from City and Marc wants to do it, it will happen.”\n\n“Nothing in life is one-dimensional,” Glasner said. “Let’s say you have a nice car but you need money because it’s cold and a window [at home] is broken, and somebody offers you crazy money for your car. You say, ‘No, I don’t want to sell my car. I love my car. But I don’t want to freeze.’ Then you say, ‘If I can get the window and even a new roof, you can have the car. But I would like to keep it.’\n\n“It’s the same with Marc. Everybody wants him to play for Crystal Palace, sign a new contract and stay here for ever.”\n\n“On the other side, the contract ends this summer and if somebody is coming and you are freezing, there will be a moment when the club says, ‘Now the financial issue is more important than the sporting issue and we have to do it.”\n\n“There will be a threshold where if Marc says he wants to leave and the money is above the threshold, it will happen.”\n\n“The money was not above the threshold,” he said of Guéhi’s collapsed move to Liverpool. “Maybe it was close. If somebody had offered £80million for Marc and Marc said he wanted to go, then Marc wouldn’t be a Crystal Palace player.”",

It's clear that a lot of his NBA takes are primarily given through a blatant Celtics lens, which is really jarring to hear as someone who has been listening for a decent amount of time.\n\nCan any oldheads who have listened to Bill for a longer amount of time (perhaps a week or maybe even a month) weigh in on this?
