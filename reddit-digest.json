Believe in yourself: Four years ago, I was a two-star recruit playing high school football 30 minutes from Hard Rock Stadium with a dream of playing at the highest level. Two days ago, I became a National Champion in that same stadium, surrounded by the family who never stopped believing in me.\n\n2. Take the risk: When it’s 4th and 5 at the 12-yard line, go for it. \n\n3.

        "selftext": "It's not clear when Jeanie learned about the promise between JoAnn and her father, but when she spoke over the phone with Jesse on that 2019 call, in what multiple sources with knowledge of it say marked a sharp pivot from the topic of the Davis news conference, she brought it up.\n\n\n\nGiven that promise between her mother and father, Jeanie told Jesse, \"You should've never been born.\"\n\n\n\nJesse processed the words, according to the three people briefed on the call.\n\n\n\n\"You should've never been born.\"\n\n\n\nThe words echoed in more ways than one. There had always been distance between the four older and the two younger siblings -- and not just because of the pronounced age gap, with 31 years separating the oldest (Johnny) and youngest (Jesse). The older siblings often said that their father was frequently absent during their childhoods and that his empire was built by the time Joey and Jesse were born.\n\n\n\n\"When Joey and Jesse arrived, watching my dad and the joyful part of fatherhood and watching him engage with them, it reminded me of the things that he missed when I was growing up,\" Jeanie said in the 2022 Hulu series.\n\n\n\nNews of Jeanie's comments on the call with Jesse soon made the rounds within the organization and to Joey.\n\n\n\n\"It's mind-blowing that she would say that,\" said someone on the team who became aware of the remarks. \"I don't care who you are. You don't say that to somebody else.\"\n\n\n\nSaid another: \"Why would that ever get thrown into somebody's face? I don't know.\"\n\n\n\nOf Jeanie's alleged remark to Jesse, Janie said, \"I can't imagine my sister saying that, but that was the truth. They \\[Jerry and JoAnn\\] did have an understanding.\"\n\n\n\nAn obvious but ominous dynamic had revealed itself from that call, people close to the family told ESPN -- the remark was perhaps a sign of something more, a deep-rooted resentment that for decades had lingered.\n\n\n\n\"That,\" someone close to the family said, \"was the beginning of the end.\"\n\n\n\nIN THE YEARS since, multiple team sources said they sensed Jeanie's priorities beginning to shift. The organization took significant criticism over how it was being run, and she often took it personally, those close to her said.\n\n\n\nWhen external critics called the organization cheap, they were calling her cheap. When critics questioned why she listened to Linda and Kurt Rambis, they were questioning her judgment. When Pelinka came under public fire for the team's roster construction, she took barbs for standing by him. She was quick to label critics as wrong, cruel and biased.\n\n\n\nShe tightened her circle. She grew more suspicious of leaks. She crafted her public image -- and narrative -- through favorable media coverage. \"She's PR savvy, and she utilizes it,\" a team member said. \"She prioritizes that.\"\n\n\n\nShe also came to be known in some circles for turning against those who were close to her and dear to the franchise. She had done so to Jerry West. She had done so to her brother Jim.\n\n\n\nAnd team sources tell ESPN she even began to turn against the Lakers' star player, LeBron James.\n\n\n\nJeanie privately grumbled, people close to the team say, about what she felt was James' outsized ego and the overt control that he and Klutch Sports, which represents both James and Anthony Davis, exerted over the organization at times.\n\n\n\nShe didn't like that James was considered a savior for a foundering franchise when he arrived in 2018 and that it was he who chose the Lakers rather than the team's leadership receiving praise for landing him. Team sources have been adamant for years that James' camp informed the Lakers as early as 2017 that he was coming to join them when he became a free agent the following year.\n\n\n\nThe distance between Jeanie and James widened after the Lakers traded for Russell Westbrook in July 2021, people close to the team said. The team had made the trade in an effort to appease James, but the acquisition backfired in catastrophic fashion. L.A. went 33-49 and missed the playoffs, and James seemed to wash his hands of his role in the acquisition.\n\n\n\nJeanie privately bristled about what she felt was his lack of accountability and the way James would shift blame onto others after the Westbrook trade, the people said.\n\n\n\nIn 2022, in the aftermath of the Westbrook trade, multiple people said Jeanie privately mused about not giving James a contract extension and, later that year, even about trading James, with the LA Clippers floated as a possibility. (This was before James received a no-trade clause in July 2024 after signing a new two-year, $104 million contract.)\n\n\n\nAnd when the Lakers drafted James' son Bronny with the 55th pick in the 2024 draft, Jeanie privately remarked that James should be grateful for such a gesture, but she felt that he wasn't, people close to the team told ESPN.\n\n\n\nThat summer, as she discussed a new contract for James, Jeanie seemed more resigned to the fact that they'd have to do it -- almost begrudgingly accepting that they'd take a massive PR hit by not doing so.\n\n\n\nUnder Jeanie's leadership, the team had been through years of dysfunction -- of distrust, increasing isolation and discord -- and then, there was the on-court product.\n\n\n\nThe Lakers had missed the playoffs twice in 34 seasons under Jerry Buss; by spring 2024, they had missed the playoffs seven times in the 11 seasons since.\n\n\n\nThey had won 10 titles under Buss; they had won one since. They had posted the NBA's best winning percentage under Buss; they had posted the 26th-best since.\n\n\n\nSince the team moved from Minneapolis to Los Angeles, seven of the team's 11 worst seasons in terms of winning percentage -- including the four worst -- had all come since Buss died and Jeanie took over.\n\n\n\nSource: [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\\_/id/47594947/inside-jeanie-jerry-buss-family-infighting-drove-10b-sale-los-angeles-lakers-mark-walter](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/47594947/inside-jeanie-jerry-buss-family-infighting-drove-10b-sale-los-angeles-lakers-mark-walter)",

        "selftext": "Over the course of last weekend, an X account with 1.5 million followers that purports to offer “unrivalled football coverage” and is blue-tick verified (and thus able to monetise their posts) posted five times about Marseille striker [Mason Greenwood](https://inews.co.uk/topic/mason-greenwood?ico=in-line_link).\n\n“How much longer can Thomas Tuchel ignore Mason Greenwood?” read one, with the statement written all in capitals – it got 3.3 million views. Other lines: “Thomas Tuchel, are you watching?!”, “Arguably the most in-form English player there is (plus 12 exclamation marks)”. They then posted a survey about Greenwood being in the England squad.\n\nWhen Marseille manager Roberto De Zerbi described Greenwood as worthy of the Ballon D’Or – hyperbolic before you consider everything else – football journalist Fabrizio Romano mocked up a photo of Greenwood receiving the award from De Zerbi on Instagram to his 41.5 million followers. His post was tagged as from “Marseille, France”.\n\nAnother X account, this time with only tens of thousands of followers (also blue-tick verified), falsely attributed a quote to England manager Thomas Tuchel: “I would rather lose without him than win with him.” That post was seen 3.4 million views. \n\nThis is merely a sample. This Greenwood stanning has created its own corner of football social media and recently that corner has become increasingly noisy. Over recent weeks, I’ve noticed a significant increase in pro-Greenwood posts on X alone.\n\nThe posts about him typically generate high engagement, particularly those who champion the player for a place in England’s World Cup squad. They are thus a goldmine for those who wish to monetise through engagement. Perhaps they are all simply big Ligue 1 supporters with no idea of the context. Perhaps. \n\nFor those who need to be reminded, Greenwood has not been picked for any England squad since being suspended by Manchester United in January 2022 following the player’s arrest after images and videos were posted on social media reporting sexual and physical violence. In February 2023, the Crown Prosecution Service discontinued the charges after “the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light”. [Greenwood denied all charges](https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/mason-greenwood-leave-man-utd-six-month-investigation-2561869?ico=in-line_link).\n\nA Nigerian Youtuber, whose bio lists him as a Fifa accredited photo journalist, with almost a million followers on X posted: “I love how Marseille is promoting Greenwood” with a fire emoji. One of the top replies discusses how “failure has made him even better”, as if this is an issue purely of missed chances or hamstring injuries. \n\nSocial media is a wild west of opinion and there are those who believe that Greenwood deserves another chance with England. That is bleakly dispiriting. The Oxford Dictionary word of the year is “rage bait”, content deliberately designed, posted or phrased to provoke anger, and that is another theory. Do those running these accounts believe in Greenwood’s cause or are they simply producing content designed to provocate?\n\nWhat the “second chance” implorers fail to appreciate – deliberately or otherwise – is that playing for Marseille, with a manager who is seemingly happy to praise the football to the hilt in public (which I also find grim) [*is* the second chance](https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/barcelona-real-madrid-mason-greenwood-form-exit-3287214?ico=in-line_link). Being picked for your country is a privilege, not a right based entirely upon on-pitch form. Tuchel said in September that Greenwood was not under consideration for selection. Good on him for that.\n\nMuch of this strikes as a playground of aggressive toxic masculinity, reflected in the below-the-line arguments of those who insist that it is Greenwood who is being made a victim through his omission from England’s squads. That is highly depressing given the images and videos allegedly containing Greenwood we saw.\n\nAfter an internal investigation using material not in the public domain and speaking to people involved in the case, Manchester United said they were “satisfied that Mason did not commit the acts he was charged with” but “Mason accepted that he had made mistakes”.\n\nIt’s one thing to call for his inclusion without detailing the history that may form the backbone of the argument against it. Single posts and replies are distasteful, distraction through omission of the key details for why Greenwood left England for Getafe and Marseille in the first place.\n\nBut a concerted campaign over time? That is morally abhorrent and I believe it deserves great censure. Social media is not compulsory; your posts are a choice and, if you have a million followers or more, it comes with responsibility because of the broad range of your audience. \n\nTrumpeting the international hopes of this player is a flagrant breach of that moral code. You should know what you’re doing and you should know what impact it may have on people. You cannot say “hey, this is just a football thing” when the complexities of this situation demand better. There is a duty of care that extends beyond one bloke, an England squad and your engagement metrics on social media.",

Petzing could do really well or he could be a bust. We don’t know. A lot of people seem to be trying to leverage themselves into an “I told you so” situation. Lots of name-calling and finger-pointing going around. I have my reservations about the decision but I’m not going to say next season is 100% a bust and nobody should be hoping that Petzing does poorly just so they can say they were right. It’s entirely possible to think this wasn’t the best decision AND want him to do well this year because he’s now the OC whether we want it or not. And him doing well means the lions offense is doing well which is something EVERYONE here should want. I’d be glad to be wrong about the hiring decision.\n\nEDIT: if you’d like to see a prime example of discussion devolving into name-calling check the longer thread in this comment.

        "selftext": "It's Thanksgiving Day 1980, a snowstorm hits so we stay home, and I watch my first full Detroit Lions game of my life. I can't think of a more fitting personal introduction to my Lions fandom than that game vs. the Bears (if you know, you know). Anyway, the Lions sported these uniforms during that home game, in the Silverdome.\n\nIt was Kung Fu Billy Sims' rookie season, and he was ELECTRIFYING. \n\nAccording to my research, Sims and the Lions wore the pictured home uniforms from 1980 to 1981. They featured large and sparkly silver metallic numbers, and they POPPED. I got a Number 20 jersey, and I still remember loving how cool that shirt looked, with its big sparkly silver numbers, trimmed in white. \n\nThey say the Lions nixed these uniforms because opponents complained of glare from the numbers, which also made them hard to read on film or in sunlight. \n\nApparently in the 2026 season, the NFL is allowing new alternate uniforms to be added into the rotation, as part of its \"Rivalries\" program. How about we bring THIS uniform BACK? \n\nI mean the whole thing - the same shirt, the same silver pants with the blue pinstripes, and the same high ankle striped socks (we could keep our new and improved helmet). Why? Because this uniform looks GREAT! To my eyes, the BEST the Lions have ever looked! Tastes vary and I respect that, but that's my opinion about it, and I hope other fans would feel the same. Come on now, do the monochromatic Blueberries and Marshmallows really look better than THIS? To me, and to so many players, teams and fans past, the Lions are SILVER and BLUE, not monochrome. \n\nThis uniform has a great heritage too, as along with Sims, here are some other notable Lions who wore it: Doug English, Bubba Baker, Dexter Bussey and Eddie Murray. Wearing it, we could pay homage to Lions players and teams past, while enjoying the now with exciting players like Gibbs, all while looking super sharp! \n\nWould these silver numbers still cause the same problems today? I don't know - if they're sending people to Mars, don't you think they could engineer some jersey numbers to look the same, without blinding anybody? \n\nWe could call these the Disco Uniforms, because they sprung out of the Disco era, looking like a sparkling disco ball. Not all disco songs were bad! \n\nThere are full Lions games posted on youtube where they wear these uniforms, so you can see how they looked in real time. \n\nMaybe the Lions would listen to us if there's a popular fan movement for the Disco Uniforms, so who's with me on this? LET'S GOOOO!",
