        "selftext": "Hélène Hendriks does not have fond memories of Diego Costa. The former Atlético Madrid striker behaved rudely during an interview in the coronavirus era.\n\n\n\nHendriks was a reporter during the Champions League round of 16 match between Liverpool and Atlético (2-3) in March 2020. While the Netherlands was already in lockdown, the stadium was still full. “In the end, 41 of the people who were in that stadium died of COVID-19,” Hendriks said in the HNM podcast.\n\n\n\nAfter the match, Hendriks conducted interviews. “First I had Virgil van Dijk, then Diego Costa came. Do you know what Diego Costa did? He walked up and deliberately coughed in the face of everyone standing there.” The presenter found the striker's action distasteful. “I don't get angry easily, but I wanted to run after him and say, ‘What are you doing to me?’”\n\n\n\n“He coughed right in my face,” emphasizes Hendriks, who was not wearing a face mask at the time. “But I was attached to a wire for the connection with the Netherlands, and I was walking behind Diego Costa, so the whole camera fell over. I didn't know what had happened to me. I thought it was outrageous.” Two days later, Hendriks had the coronavirus, she says. “What a jerk! What an asshole!” says Noa Vahle.\n\n\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)",

But the Austrian left at the end of the 2021-22 season after it was decided he would not take up the consultancy role, which cost the club £14.7m.\n\nErik ten Hag seemed likely to lose his job in the wake of winning the FA Cup against Manchester City in 2024 but United ultimately ended up triggering a one-year extension in his deal only to sack him 116 days later.\n\nHis departure cost United £10.4m and now Amorim has become the latest casualty of the club’s managerial merry-go-round.\n\nIn addition to those costs, United have also forked out almost £21m bringing in managers and hiring and firing executives.\n\nUnited paid Newcastle around £3m to extract Dan Ashworth only to sack their sporting director five months later, which cost them £4.1m in compensation.\n\nMolde received a goodwill payment of around £1m when Solskjaer left the Norwegian club to become United manager, initially on an interim basis, in December 2018.\n\nAjax were paid £1.6m by United for the loss of Ten Hag and assistant Mitchell van der Gaag.\n\nUnited paid Southampton about £1m in compensation to secure the services of Jason Wilcox, initially as technical director. Wilcox is now United’s director of football.\n\nThe compensation bill paid to Sporting for Amorim remains by far the biggest hiring cost.\n\n[Source.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk)",

The players wouldn’t want to do this so they would try to win every game that they can, making games competitive for as much of the season as possible. \n\nOf course, the teams that get eliminated from playoff contention are usually the worst teams that fans don’t come to watch, but the jeans solve this. Tell me you wouldn’t go watch your team when the kings come to town in late February, and they are all stuck wearing jeans to play basketball. This is the entertainment the NBA needs, it just is!",
