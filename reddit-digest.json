Entered the playoffs cold and lost in the Wild Card round.\n\n• **2024 Pittsburgh Steelers**  \nFinished 10-7 but dropped their last four games. Several outlets noted they were only the third team in NFL history to enter the playoffs on a four-game losing streak.\n\n• **1986 New York Jets** (a little different but worth mentioning)  \nThey lost five straight to end the season, still made the playoffs, and actually won their Wild Card game before losing the next round.\n\nSo if the Packers lose this Vikings game and head into the playoffs on a four-game skid, they would be joining a list that is basically two teams long, or three if you include the Jets with the longer streak.",

He comes in, spaces the floor, pressures the ball, and doesn’t need the offense run for him to contribute.\n\nWhat really stands out is how natural he looks in the role.

This would keep the value of both winning your conference title game and winning a bowl game without losing the ability to have a playoff.  It would allow teams like say 2021 Cincinnati or 2023 Florida State to prove themselves without locking up a playoff spot for a team with a big question mark or weak schedule.  ",

Play the quarter finals at four of them.  it would look like this:   \nCotton Bowl: Miami vs. Ohio State  \nSugar Bowl: Ole Miss vs. Georgia  \n  \nOrange BOwl: Oregon vs. Texas Tech  \nRose Bowl: Alabama vs. Indiana\n\nThen the semi-finals take place a week later, at the two remaining bowl games:  Example above it would be Fiesta Bowl:  Ole Miss/Georgia winner vs. OSU/Miami winner  \nPeach Bowl:  Indiana/Alabama winner vs.  Oregon/Texas Tech winner\n\nThen do a standalone national title game.  Probably even better would be to do 12 teams, and have a round before the quarterfinals to play into the bowl games.  Then all of those bowl games still matter and you have plenty of room for any undefeated team to make it even with an injury to their quarterback.  Maybe even guarantee a spot to a non-Power 4 team so cincy could get in.   Probably would have people complaining about the selection of teams 9-12 when weighing head-to-head vs. bad losses, etc. Conference title games are harder to make as important as they would have been before, but they mattered to Clemson and they determine the seeding / bye, so seems they just mean less to fans/media than the teams.",
