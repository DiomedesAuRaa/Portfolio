Then, you add the *constant* shuffling and C and LG plus the ongoing injury at LT (remember that Decker *barely* practiced this season even when he was playing) and it's undeniable that Goff's protection was significantly worse. \n\n* Goff got a significant downgrade at OC and had to switch playcallers halfway through the year.\n\n* The run game was massively inconsistent. While it helped the offense at times, it completely disappeared in other games.\n\n* Goff basically did not have a tight end to work with all year. After the injuries to SLP and then even Wright, the TE spot was PS guys for the back half of the season. \n\n* St Brown had an uncharacteristic number of drops this year and, for as much as we all love Jamo, he is still among the league leaders in drop rate. \n\nYet despite all of these things, Goff remains:\n\n* Top three in passing yards\n\n* Top three in passer rating\n\n* Top two in TDs\n\n* Top two in TD-INT ratio\n\n* Top five in completion percentage \n\n* Top ten in yards per completion (top 7 if you remove QBs with 8 or fewer starts)\n\nIs he perfect every game? Obviously not. Does his inability to scramble limit him in ways that impact the game? Yes. \n\nBut can you look at these stats *considering the situation around Goff* and say that *he* is the problem? No idea how you get there.",

He comes in, spaces the floor, pressures the ball, and doesn’t need the offense run for him to contribute.\n\nWhat really stands out is how natural he looks in the role. He’s decisive, plays under control, and doesn’t hijack possessions. That’s exactly what you want next to Cade or running the second unit.",
