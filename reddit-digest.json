TMZ Sports has learned that the person behind the mask has lawyered up -- and has selected the attorney that represented Sofia Jamora in her domestic violence lawsuit against Hayes.\n\nWaukeenMcCoy told us that he is now representing the person Hayes decked when the Lakers were in town for a showdown with Washington on January 30.\n\n\"We will give them the opportunity to resolve the matter before taking legal action,\" McCoy said. \"But legal action is anticipated.\"\n\nHe also said other parties could be involved.\n\nWhen asked about any injuries the person sustained ... McCoy said, \"All I want to say at the moment is that he was injured.\"\n\nAs you know, Hayes was suspended for one game by the NBA after the incident. He served that suspension during the Lakers' game against the Philadelphia 76ers last week at Crypto.com Arena.",

Do you think there is a flaw in the NFL that a smaller number of games is more beneficial than a larger number of games? \n\nTheres obviously things that need to be fixed in the NBA, but not understanding why shrinking the schedule might help is just stupid.",
