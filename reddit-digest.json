        "selftext": "I was the head coach at Ole Miss for 6 years and in that time I went to two New Year’s Six bowl games: the 2022 Sugar Bowl and the 2023 Peach Bowl. We lost 21–7 to Baylor in the Sugar Bowl. The next season, we started out 7–0 but finished 8–5 because I was almost going to Auburn before my daughter convinced me to stay. In 2023, we had the first 11-win season in program history.\n\nLast season, we were expected to make the College Football Playoff, but we went 10–3 because we had close losses to Kentucky, LSU, and Florida. It was “Playoff or bust” and we failed.\n\nThis season, we went 11–1 but I left the team to be the next head coach at LSU. Keith Carter wouldn’t let me coach in the Playoff even though these are my players. I just think these people have treated me unfairly even after all I’ve done for Ole Miss football. I’m waging war on Ole Miss because they should’ve just let me coach and *then* leave for LSU after the CFP. After all, I built this program into what it is today. The minute they lose a CFP game I’m planning on tampering to get Trinidad Chambliss and Kewan Lacy to come to Baton Rouge because I deserve to have those great players on my roster. I really do hope Ole Miss goes all the way, however, but again I did deserve to coach them in the Playoff.\n\nAITA for waging war on Ole Miss because they wouldn’t let me coach in the Playoff?",

His reputation as an elite SMG feels like it’s fallen off hard, and I’m trying to understand why.\n\nHis résumé is strong: ROTY, 3× chips, 1× ring, 2× All-Star. He was the best SMG in Vanguard and top-tier in MWII, a demon on Seattle Surge, and still very good on OpTic. He also won a World Championship in 2024.\n\nSince leaving OpTic and joining Falcons, though, it feels like the community has completely moved on. Players like Simp, Shotzzy, aBeZy, HyDra, Huke, etc. are now ranked above him with little debate.\n\nWas this due to role, team situation, meta changes, or just recency bias?

        "selftext": "During this lull between Christmas and New Year's, I got to thinking about the \"Shakey's game\" (which I have always understood to be the first Wild Card game on Saturday). I wondered what the furthest any team to play in a Shakey's game has ever gotten in the playoffs.\n\nBecause I have far too much free time on my hands, I decided to look at every Shakey's game since the 2000-01 playoffs to find out exactly that. I also found a bunch of other interesting trivia (to sports nerds and sports nerds only) that I thought I should share here.\n\nSince 2000:\n\n\\- 1 Shakey's game participant has won the Super Bowl (2006 Colts)\n\n\\- 2 participants have made it to the Super Bowl but lost (2008 Cardinals, 2021 Bengals)\n\n\\- 4 participants made it to a Conference Championship Game but lost (2001 Eagles, 2009 Jets, 2020 Bills, 2022 49ers)\n\n\\- The other 18 Shakey's game winners immediately flamed out in the Divisional round\n\n\\- The Houston Texans (unsurprisingly) own the Shakey's game, having appeared in it \\*literally\\* every time they've made the playoffs -- 8 appearances with a 6-2 record. Though it seems they'll be spared this year by either Carolina or Tampa Bay.\n\n\\- The Shakey's game is played more often between AFC teams (17 times) than NFC teams (7 times) which probably says something about who the NFL thinks the most interesting teams are. Between 2015 and 2021, the Shakey's game featured only AFC teams.\n\n\\- Andy Reid's Chiefs playoff debut was in a Shakey's game -- a game in which the Chiefs were on the losing end of the second biggest comeback in NFL playoff history\n\n\\- The \"Beast Quake\" game was a Shakey's game\n\n\\- Josh Allen, Joe Burrow, and Brock Purdy each got their first playoff win in a Shakey's game\n\n\\- And until recently, Philip Rivers' final game was a Shakey's game\n\n\\- The last time the Dolphins won a playoff game was a Shakey's game\n\n\\- There have been 2 Shakey's shutouts (2002 Jets beat Colts 41-0, 2015 Chiefs beat Texans 30-0)\n\n\\- Only one Shakey's game has gone to overtime (2019 Texans beat Bills 22-19)\n\nSorry if that was a lot. I had just compiled all this information and felt I needed to unload it somehow without sounding like a deranged person to my friends and family.",
