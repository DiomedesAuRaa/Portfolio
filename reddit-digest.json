        "selftext": "\n\nEdit: Thanks to all that have chimed in and added your takes. Originally I mentioned DTLA isnt worth visiting but several helpful redditors have corrected me that there's still several valuable gems to see. Everyone please refer to the comments as well for additional great options! \n\nBorn and raised and still live here and most of this will be for local to the SGV area: \n\nThe LA area is HUGE. Pasadena is a city of 150k and considered somewhat average in size. Things arent as close by as they appear on a map due to it all being a concrete jungle. There is nothing but city everywhere you look. It will be cold and rain is expected(I think itll be in like the 60s weather wise). \n\nWant to see some cool areas? Griffith observatory in Los Feliz IS A MUST, The broad museum in DTLA, The Last Book Store in DTLA, Huntington Library/Gardens if you stay in Pasadena, Descanso gardens in La Canada(15 mins from pasadena), both are amazing for picture taking and the Descanso gardens makes you feel like youre a hobbit walking through lord of the rings. \n\nFancy-er restaurants? The royce wood, The Raymond, The Arbour, Gaucho Grill, Arroyo chop house, The Terrace, Perle, Starleaf, Houstons, Mi Piazi, The Derby, Sushi Roku, Din Tai Fung(Dumpling house), Parkway Grill. And then higher-end chains like Flemings steakhouse, Ruth Chris Steakhouse, Fogo De Chao(All you can eat Braziliann bbq if you're unaware). \n\nPlenty of regular chain restaurants(Cheesecake, BJs, Olive garden, etc) and other regular affordable restaurants all around the area as well if you want budget and familiar. There's this awesome hidden italian spot in Old Town Pasadena called \"The Kitchen\", I personally love it. Sushi Kyo in Monrovia, Urban plates in Pasadena is a healthy but delicious option. Chris's KBBQ in Pasadena and OO Kook KBBQ in Rosemead are good, definitely recommend. \n\nWhere to walk around locally? Old town pasadena, thats where all the bars/clubs/restaurants/shops are at. It's one long street(Colorado Blvd). Bunch of affordable restaurants of different varieties(Sushi, Ramen, Bar food, Italian, Wings, Mexican, Japanese, etc). Right next door in Arcadia is the Mall(one of the last great malls that is regularly crowded with updated stores, they even have a Lego store and coach store lol). Americana in Glendale is a great walk through with good photo opportunities. \n\nBest local sports bars? Rocco's, Barney's Beanery, Der Wolf, Kings Row. Barney's and Rocco's are the most family friendly.  If you had 2 cities over(15 min drive) to Monrovia there's London's. \n\nWant dessert? Afters(open until like 5 am), and there's a bunch of unique desert spots littered throughout the city. Moo moo Mia in Monrovia is good too with unique flavors. \n\nPlan to visit the beach? Do NOT go to Santa Monica. Get a ride to South Bay(Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach). Hermosa beach has the best pier area with plenty of restaurants of the 3. If you have the opportunity to drive a little bit longer, go to Malibu(weather dependent). \n\nLastly, being inside the Rose Bowl is beautiful. The surrounding area is very wealthy(old generational money) and upscale. When you're in the stadium, you can see the San Gabriel mountains right in the backdrop as well as the surrounding forested area. Expect stadium food and beer prices to run you $75 for a family of 4 for getting 1 meal each. Beer will run you up to $15 per just depending. \n\nAll my other LA bros can chime in as well. im probably missing some stuff but thats off the top of my head. ",

Both OpTic and FaZe owners have stepped in the last year and signed a player without players asking for it. I think more power needs to be taken from the players and more decisions like these need to happen. \n\nWith challengers popping FaZe and Optic are adapting and taking advantage of this. I usually hate Zinni but I’m not sure without him the Huntsman are around and same goes for big nose. They are developing and embracing challengers while LAT is letting Scrap and Hydra rule the roost. \n\nGood for Kaysan for seeing the bigger picture and I think if this works out it will be the future of FaZe CoD.",

He was a big piece to our team last year and I feel like he didn’ get enough credit.\n\nI do not. Outside of the games in which he got super hot from the perimeter, he was a consistently minus-value player on the court. Yay for his veteran presence and all, but the only thing he did well was hitting wide-open threes and attracting some gravity. He was bad at everything else, and terrible overall in the postseason. \n\nDenver offered him a guaranteed role, and I doubt the Pistons did the same. They needed minutes for Holland and Ivey and to replace Schroder with another handler (ultimately LeVert). \n\n> Also honorable mention: Simone fontechio. He’s had stretches where he struggled but he was a great all around wing and I think he also didn’t get the credit he deserves.\n\nI'm curious why you think so, because he was bad across the board last season. He shot league average from three in only a single month of the season, he routinely struggled on defense, and he provided pretty much nothing of particular value.\n\nHe started out strong with the Heat this season but has since taken a massive dump.",
