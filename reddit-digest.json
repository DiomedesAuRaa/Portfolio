They smash us twice”\n\nThe most media savvy answer is to not answer.  “I’m not going there.  We played and they won.” But I’m not going to fault a kid for not being that on their toes and I’m not going to fault them for refusing to say “we lose again”.

They can score, they can play good team defense, but they haven't played the top of the league without Ivankovic yet so it could get a little rough here.
