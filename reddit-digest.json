        "selftext": "So, I have no idea how the folks who run this place feel about unsubstantiated rumors, but the guy who posted this is a longtime MGoBlog forum member, and yes, his story about having the inside dirt on Harbaugh coming from a friend still tied to the AD does check out. He wasn't lying then, and I suspect he's not lying now:\n\n[https://mgoblog.com/mgoboard/have-info-do-not-shoot-messenger-merry-christmas](https://mgoblog.com/mgoboard/have-info-do-not-shoot-messenger-merry-christmas)\n\nIt's not a long post, but I'll save you the click and just C&P what he said below:\n\n\"Again, not first hand.  Buddy used to work at AD, still connected, but everything now further removed.  Those that remember can vouch- he was telling me Harbaugh was Happening!, back in the day when everyone was saying No way!, and I shared here early.\n\nAnyways…\n\n1. Regents are not really in-fighting and politics not as bad as appear from outside, but Wards is definitely lame duck and will be gone with or without cause after investigation.  “Too much embarrassment has befallen the university under his watch to keep him in charge” Obviously, they’d prefer to do it with cause, but also not open up Pandora’s box - so full transparency unlikely here and lawyers will ultimately decide how this goes down for minimal further collateral damage.\n2. Search firm handling everything. Warde is not involved/“sidelined.” Regents are getting feedback, but also not driving the search. Votes by the regents and interim president have been used to yay or nay the list of candidates from firm.\n3. Dillingham agent was contacted. Interview with search firm never happened as Dillingham asks were met by ASU.  Dillingham agent apparently upset as appears ASU now balking on some of promised resources/NIL as promised what may not be deliverable.  Not our problem, though.\n4. Brohm was never a real option. Just one of many feelers put out, internet ran with it. Now relevant stuff:\n5. DeBoer was option #1 and had Bama lost, was likely next coach. Agent is/was already in talks with firm, he wants UM job, Bama not his best fit. Timeline not lining up and if Bama goes deep into playoff, obviously, he earns cred with fanbase.  Fwiw: Family not liking Tuscaloosa - preferred UW.\n6. Monken indeed top of list and if Ravens eliminated from playoffs, can expect him to receive the first actual contact offer from UM in this search. Firm is/was interested in John Harbaugh, but even if fired unlikely he does college - his agent told UM - Not happening.  They landed on Monken by first shaking the branches on John Harbaugh. On the table: Contract details early: Monken would likely come in as the 2nd highest paid B1G coach behind Day: 4 years, $12mm/year.  No details on potential buyout, etc.  That’s my 3rd hand info.  Do with it as you wish. \"\n\nTo me? All of this seems plausible. And while I can absolutely live with Monken, hearing that we were \\*this\\* close to DeBoer is going to haunt me for a very, very long time. Apparently, Oklahoma beat us twice in 2025. I've lusted after DeBoer for three whole years now; I am inconsolable. \n\n",
