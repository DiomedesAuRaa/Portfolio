He lost literally every 1 on 1 rep he took at Guard in the Senior bowl. It was concerning. When you compare his performance to Gray Zabel's this time last year, the difference is astonishing -- and last year's DL class was a lot better than this year's.\n\nFor reference so you can see what I'm talking about: [https://x.com/CoachMadProphet/status/2016285134975054208](https://x.com/CoachMadProphet/status/2016285134975054208)\n\nI wouldn't object to taking him in the 2nd.
