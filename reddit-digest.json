        "selftext": "MIAMI GARDENS — Sometimes Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel walks around the team facility carrying a wooden baseball bat in menacing fashion. Occasionally McDaniel will take the bat to a team meeting. The bat has meaning.\n\n“I think it’s a reminder to be violently present in everything you do,” fullback Alec Ingold said. “I think it’s a reminder to lock in on the moment. That’s kind of his tool that he’s been using this year.”\n\nMcDaniel, who is thought to be fighting for his job, might be doing his best coaching this season. The baseball bat is symbolic of McDaniel’s ability to breathe life into his message to players, it’s an example of transforming an idea into a tangible instrument.\n\nApparently it’s working.\n\nGranted, the Dolphins (7-9) are assured of their second consecutive losing season. But they’ve won six of their last nine games.\n\nThe way left tackle Patrick Paul recalls things, the bat appeared out of nowhere around midseason, around the time the Dolphins went from 1-6 to 2-7 and then 3-7, 4-7 and so on.\n\n“At some point in the season, I just saw him with a bat, and I was like, ‘Alright,’ ” Paul said with mild curiosity. “…but now it does make sense. It’s like, ‘We’re still in this, we’re fine.’ ”\n\nThe baseball bat gets the job done on a few levels.\n\n“I think the thing about it is the tone it sets,” Paul said. “It’s like we’re bringing weapons. And we’re coming for a fight. I think it’s rallying us and showing us that we’re in a fight. So I think it’s symbolizing the fight.”\n\nSometimes McDaniel will give the bat to a player.\n\nLast week outside linebacker Derrick McClendon proudly paraded it on the field for pregame warmups before the Tampa Bay game at Hard Rock Stadium. He did the same for the New York Jets game at MetLife Stadium.\n\n“I do know there’s been multiple bats,” Ingold said, “and guys get their hands on it and they start walking around with it. I think it’s cool that guys bought into it, too. \n\n“It’s a baseball bat, but at the same time it’s a good reminder for everyone. And with dudes picking it up and walking around the locker room, it’s a cool deal.”\n\nBefore we go further, let’s not exaggerate the role the bat has played in the Dolphins’ resurgence in the second half of the season. And let’s not pretend it makes McDaniel into some magical character.\n\nAfter all, no one will ever confuse McDaniel with Sheriff Buford Pusser from the movie “Walking Tall.”\n\nTo our knowledge, McDaniel has never used the bat for destructive purposes and then quoted Principal Joe Clark, actor Morgan Freeman’s character from the movie “Lean on Me” — “They used to call me crazy Joe. Well, now they call me batman.”\n\nAnd we don’t think McDaniel is trying to channel his inner President Theodore Roosevelt — “Walk softly and carry a big stick.”\n\nTruth be told, not every player is into the baseball bat. They’ve all seen it. But players have varying degrees of interest.\n\n“I couldn’t tell you anything about it,” wide receiver Jaylen Waddle said.\n\nLinebacker Jordyn Brooks showed slightly more intrigue.\n\n“I really don’t know what it means,” Brooks said. “I think it’s like a mentality thing. To be honest, I never really asked about it.”\n\nOffensive lineman Daniel Brunskill gets it, but it’s not exactly his style.\n\n“It doesn’t really do anything for me,” he said. “I’m just more into the football stuff. But I get it for some guys.\n\n“It’s like, ‘Hey, we’re going to crack some kneecaps, go bust some a–,’ and it kind of just brings a mentality. So some guys definitely get fired up by that.”\n\nBut the bat is important. Players say the bat also symbolizes McDaniel’s focus on the job directly ahead of him — winning the next game on the schedule — while ignoring all the outside noise about his job security.\n\nPlayers say in that regard, McDaniel has been unflappable.\n\n“I would say he’s been the same him throughout the season,” outside linebacker Bradley Chubb said. “When we were at a point where we needed for sure to win some games, a sense of urgency came about. He had a sense of urgency all season, you just saw it cranked up a little bit. Talking about his personality and how he approaches every day, I feel like it’s been the same.”\n\nThere’s a chance that Sunday’s season finale at New England is McDaniel’s last game as Dolphins coach. But McDaniel, who has a so-so 35-32 (.522) record in four seasons, is putting up a fight for his job. Players are offering their support.\n\n“Every day he comes in with the same approach regardless, and that’s to coach us to win football games,” Paul said. “He’s a great coach. If there is any pressure, and I don’t think there is, he’s a great coach so there shouldn’t be.”\n\nAnd they’re acknowledging the significance of the baseball bat.",

He also won a World Championship in 2024.\n\nSince leaving OpTic and joining Falcons, though, it feels like the community has completely moved on. Players like Simp, Shotzzy, aBeZy, HyDra, Huke, etc. are now ranked above him with little debate.\n\nWas this due to role, team situation, meta changes, or just recency bias?

I mean he’s gotten a lot of touchdowns. I mean compared to receptions and touchdowns, that’s pretty good. But he’s - when you’ve got a guy like that who can catch and he’s a rookie and like I said, he’s just blossomed every single week and in the run game. You know our wideouts, they have to block and they’re the best in football in doing that. But it’s been really cool to see him. I mean he just - and really, he’s not a rookie anymore. And he comes to work every day - that whole unit with (Lions Assistant Head Coach/Wide Receivers) Scottie (Montgomery). He does an unbelievable job with those guys. They all have the same attitude. It’s really a cool thing.”",

People talk about pass protection but they weren't even able to get two star running backs going in 90% of our games. It really is unbelievable. \n\nMeanwhile the Bears picked up Joe Thuney a zero injury kinda guy who is top 5 in pass and run blocking for a FOURTH round pick. Meanwhile Brad picked up a WR we did not need for THREE third round picks.\n\nPeople are getting mad here and in the general fanbase for complaining so much but when you look at the numbers at what Brad did the past 2 offseasons I don't think the complaints are big enough.\n\n  \nWe are (were?) a Superbowl contending team players would want to come to Detroit with a shot at the Bowl they needed to leverage that into getting experienced skill players. The third round from Glenn leaving could have been Joe or literally anything we actually needed.\n\nYea it sucks that Frank retired maybe they did not know about it but it also sucks to be dealt a bad hand then instead of finding a way forward you just set your house on fire.\n\nI have a feeling Brad and Dan fell in love with our players and didn't want to force people into spots they didn't want to be in  ",
