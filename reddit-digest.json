He said it simply doesn't fit how they wanna play. \n\n\n- Gassed up how godly simp is & said he'd be a goated flex.\n\n\n- OpTic isn't much into \"parking the bus\" in overload. He believes falcons started it because they aren't good at scoring.\n\n\n- He said they knew all the nade spots & most they got caught with, they were throwing themselves. Added it takes so long to get trophies. \n\n\n- No issue with Neps spots. He said Huke & Shotzzy knew them, but didn't use them.\n\n\n- they dislike online very much & their performance on LAN only reinforced it lol, but he said they gotta lock in to secure T6 for major 2.\n\n\n- He couldn't believe how everyone kept playing faze on colossus SnD. Tipped how good they are at it.\n\n\n- the lack of variety/ability to do different things in SnD annoys him on almost all the maps.",

Metcalf claimed Kennedy called him the N-word, according to the suit. \n\nShortly after the incident, Kennedy held a press conference with two attorneys asking Metcalf to retract and apologize for his comments or face a lawsuit.\n\n“I didn’t use any racial slurs, no hate speech. I mean, none of that stuff at the game. Actually never. Fifteen years season-ticket holder for the Lions, I’ve never done that at all. So to DeKaylin, if you’re watching this man, just if you could just say that, please.”\n\nKennedy claimed he only called Metcalf by his “government” first name, DeKaylin, which triggered Metcalf’s response.\n\n[Full Article](https://www.si.com/nfl/steelers/onsi/news/lions-fan-100-million-lawsuit-dk-metcalf-pittsburgh-steelers)",

        "selftext": "For those who need to hear it, this is undoubtedly a solid move for the team. I love Ivey more than the next guy, but the reality is he did not gel with this team, and it was clear we couldn't keep him at what he wanted to be paid. Over the last few weeks, his body language has been terrible, and you could almost tell they were already planning a move. What was the absolute best-case scenario with Ivey? The reality is that, even at his best, he was never a great long-term fit alongside Cade. We can sign Daniss Jenkins for probably much less than Ivey is asking for, and he is arguably a better player / fit right now.\n\nRather than lose him for nothing, we now add a 37% CAREER three-point shooter in Huerter. Understand he's having a down year, but good shooters are hard to come by. We buy low on someone who is in a weird situation in Chicago (edit: mistakenly said ATL before, apologies) this year, hoping he slides into Detroit's system and can get his percentages up. He's also an underrated playmaker, which you can't say for a lot of the guys that people wanted in the 39-41% range. He has also played in 30 career playoff games, which, without doing any diligence, is probably going to be more than anyone in the core lineup outside of Tobias / Duncan. Finally, he's also on an expiring deal, which means no cap hit to us next season; free trial run to see how he fits in with the team.",
