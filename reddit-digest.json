        "selftext": "During his illustrious career, he achieved numerous incredible feats, including four titles, three Finals MVP awards, one league MVP award, and more. That being said, O'Neal recorded his best run with the Los Angeles Lakers, forming one of the greatest tandems in NBA history with Kobe Bryant.\n\nStill, O'Neal never felt he rightfully belonged to the GOAT conversation, something many find a little hard to believe. Touching down on the subject in the latest episode of the \"Big Podcast with Shaq\", the Diesel had one of the greatest NBA scorers, Carmelo Anthony, as his guest.\n\n\"I'm not in the GOAT conversation. Listen, it's only three people in the greatest of all time conversation. Listen, I'm arrogant, but I'm not dumb. It's Kobe, Bron, and Mike, okay, that's it. We all have our subcategories… Like, I always wanted to be Lion King. But to me, like I had to modify what I was saying,\" stated Shaq, who never understood why Kobe wasn't in the mix.\n\n\"But my thing is, if you're going to have the conversation, have the correct conversation. For so long, it was just Mike and Bron.And now I'm like,'Oh, I understand the great picks. What about the Kobster?'\" added the seven-footer, making a case for his former Lakers teammate.\n\nAlthough Shaq has on multiple occasions in the past crowned Michael Jordan as the ultimate GOAT, he did propose a new framework for the debate.\n\nShaq's only prerequisite \n\nUnlike many other NBA veterans, O'Neal did not mind revisiting the greatest of all time conversation now and then, but had only one simple rule.\n\n\"I think they should always keep it categorical… the best center, the best forward, the best guard, the best shooting guard.. Can't compare a big man to a guard. Can't do it,\" said Shaq.\n\nInterestingly, O'Neal felt the big guys, who formed a small fraction, were always at a disadvantage. His reasoning behind it was that fans always liked the guards and the little guy more, as it was comparatively easier to relate to them.\n\n  \nSource: [https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/im-arrogant-im-not-dumb-171600571.html](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/im-arrogant-im-not-dumb-171600571.html)",

I also know people hate that his brothers are on his coaching staff but Harbaugh also had a son on his staff who was an absolute beast of a coach for us so that aspect doesn’t bother me as long as they are good coaches.\n\nI think while he’s not my first pick nor is he a perfect candidate I’d be curious to see what he could do with our level of talent and a high level DC.\n\nIdk just some of my thoughts but wanna hear your guys’ thoughts!

Bickerstaff will replace him.\n\n\"I guess now might be a good time to announce, I decided about a year ago that this would be my last year,\" Carlisle said Monday night before the Pacers played in Boston. \"This is my 20th year. My term will end at the end of this month. We've held our elections, and the membership has made a tremendous and phenomenal choice to succeed me, and that's going to be J.B. Bickerstaff.\"\n\nThe 66-year-old Carlisle is one win from the 1,000th of his coaching career. He spoke very highly of his soon-to-be replacement.\n\n\"J.B. is not only a trusted friend of mine and many, many coaches, he's proven to be a great leader,\" Carlisle said. \"He's had to take over difficult situations in his career: interim coaching positions etc., etc.\n\n\"The job he did in Cleveland, taking that team from the lottery to winning in the playoffs was phenomenal. The job he's done in Detroit the last year and a half speaks for itself. He's a great leader and passionate guy for coaches.\"\n\nBickerstaff, 46, started his coaching career with Charlotte as an assistant in 2004. He was an associate head coach with Memphis until becoming interim head coach on Nov. 27, 2017. He became the Grizzlies' head coach on May 1, 2018.\n\nIn February 2020, he was promoted to Cleveland's head coach after John Beilein resigned.\n\nBickerstaff was hired as Pistons coach on July 3, 2024.\n\n\"I congratulate J.B.,\" Carlisle said. \"This will be a life-changing experience for him. It has been for me.\"\n\nBickerstaff's father, Bernie, 81, was a longtime NBA coach before moving into front-office roles. Carlisle said he'd like to see Bernie have his place in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n\"We're behind the scenes working trying to help Bernie be recognized by the Hall of Fame as a contributor,\" Carlisle said. \"There are so many ways that he influenced the game.\"",
