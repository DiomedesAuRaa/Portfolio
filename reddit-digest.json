        "selftext": "Record-wise, this season was the best Georgia Tech has had since 2014. But this season ended on a very rough stretch. Tech rambled and wrecked their way through a favorable schedule with an 8-0 start, including a win over Clemson when people thought they were still good, and reached as high as #7 in the AP poll. Yet there were shaky games and signs of concern cropping up. Sloppy wins over Wake Forest and Duke were the first alarm flags on a storm brewing in Raleigh that would begin the terrible slide. NC State haded Tech their first loss of the season was the first domino on the road to 1-4. The one win was a 2-point win over a Boston College team that finished 2-10. They had a multi-week stretch in which their defense was among the worst in the country and when they finally got it fixed against Georgia, their offense was completely stifled and held without a touchdown for the first time all season, and just the third time in the Brent Key era (second in the full-time era). It was Georgia's 8th straight win over Tech, tying the record for most consecutive wins in the series, a record Tech held for almost 70 years despite Georgia's Sisyphean quest to take it for themselves.\n\nBut wait, the Georgia game isn't a conference game, so they still went to Charlotte with a chance to win their way into the playoff via the conference champion auto-bid slot, right? Wrong! Tech was among the group of ACC teams with 2 conference losses that somehow ended up behind Duke due to the asinine tie-breakers the ACC has. Instead, they had to sit at home as Duke dookied all over the ACC's playoff hopes (save for the committee jumping Miami in at the buzzer) and their arch-rival get over their Alabama hump in emphatic fashion to lock up their 2nd straight SEC title, 3rd in the last 4 years, second straight top 4 seed in the 12 team playoff and their 4th playoff appearance in the last 5 years. Oh and they had to watch their star offensive coordinator, most of his staff, and their heir-apparent QB\\* jump ship to Florida (\\*Aaron Philo has not committed to Florida at the time of this writing but I mean come on).\n\nBut at least Notre Dame pitched a hissy fit about not getting into the playoff and they got to go to the best bowl game around in the Pop Tarts Bowl instead of the Irish. And even without their OC they were doing good! Tech had an 11-point lead with as much as 11:13 left in the game. But this is an Atlanta-based football team we're talking about here. BYU held Tech scoreless in the second half and managed to take the lead with 2 minutes to go. But Tech had 2 minutes and all 3 timeouts left to try to save the win. They would manage to get all the way to the BYU 18 with 50 seconds and all 3 of those timeouts. Engineers at heart, though, rather than try to methodically cover the final 18 yards they needed, they decided to just power through logic and force the issue with 4 straight passes to the end zone. None worked, and Haynes King's final pass as a Jacket was intercepted in the end zone to give all the Pop Tarts to the Stormin' Mormons. Well all except Slammin' Strawberry who ran from Pop Tart heaven at the last second.\n\nSo it's certainly a disappointing way to end what once looked like a very promising season for the North Avenue Trade School. And now one has to question where they go from here. In the personal opinion of this writer, Brent Key is a great coach who fits in wonderfully at Tech and he has already had more success on the flats than anyone else has in the last 10 years, certainly more than the last guy. They have a good culture down there in Midtown and they can be set up for success. But success is relative, and to be fair to Tech, the expectations are not what they are at other programs. Would I bet on Brent Key's Jackets to win a national championship? No, but I do think he's capable of consistent 8-win seasons, beating Georgia occasionally (admittedly he should have already gotten 1 win), and competing for ACC titles. But only time will tell if the hope of that future can outweigh the sour taste of what could have been that the end of this season has to have left in the mouths of every Tech fan...\n\n...Or is that just their clear whiskey and 3,000 pound barrel of rum and sugar they're pounding down there at Johnny's Hideaway?",

        "selftext": "*By Andrew Sagona*\n\nORLANDO, Fla. — Forget the game happening in a few weeks. The People’s National Championship occurred last night, and it did not disappoint. \n\nNo. 11 BYU (12–2, 8–2 Big 12) secured its first 12-win season since 2001 with a thrilling win 25–21 over No. 23 Georgia Tech (9–4, 6–2 ACC) in the 2025 Pop-Tarts Bowl that doubled as the first ranked vs. ranked matchup of the 2025–26 bowl season.\n\nAfter only a few short years, the Pop-Tarts Bowl has become the premier toaster pastry-themed sporting event on earth. The marketing team saw the Pop-Tarts appear in Ireland ahead of the Aer Lingus College Football Classic. They introduced more Pop-Tart characters and did their best to up the ante on zaniness . . .  then college football drama stepped in to kick it up a notch on Selection Sunday when Notre Dame controversially opted-out of this contest in a protest over their exclusion from the College Football Playoff. Could the game maintain the level of mania?\n\n###Crazy Game\n\nPop-Tarts’ slogan is “Crazy Good.” The on field action in this game was just purely crazy to start. ” Just to list a few of the more notable moments:\n\n* Georgia Tech lined up for a field goal attempt, shifted into a wildcat formation, leading to a touchdown by RB Trelain Maddox\n\n* Georgia Tech scored two touchdowns in 13 seconds due to a muffed kickoff return by BYU’s Cody Hagen\n\nThose two touchdowns gave the Yellow Jackets a 21–10 lead going into halftime, a lead they would maintain an absurd 3rd quarter that included:\n\n* BYU DE Nusi Taumoepeau forcing a fumble with his foot after tripping\n\n* An interception by BYU QB Bear Bachmeier being overturned due to pass interference only to be intercepted again four plays later in the end zone, on the drive immediately following the foot-forced fumble\n\n* BYU DT Keanu Tanuvasa blocking a 35 yard field goal attempt\n\nThe entire 3rd quarter was scoreless and both teams’ offenses were not accomplishing much, so there was a sense that the game might have a fairly benign ending. \n\n###Crazy Good Game\n\nThr magic of the Pop-Tarts Bowl reemerged in the 4th quarter, and thus the game went from just crazy to Crazy Good.\n \nBYU got a touchdown and a clutch two-point conversion early to bring the score to 21–18. The teams traded punts on the next three drives, and then the Cougars’ offense sprung back to life, marching 70 yards down the field in just under four minutes for the go-ahead touchdown, making the score 25–21 with exactly two minutes left.\n\nOn the ensuing drive, Georgia Tech almost fumbled away the game on the second play and then were backed up into a seemingly impossible 4th and 15 situation at their own 16 yard line. But then, Yellow Jackets’ QB Haynes King unleashed a 66-yard bomb to WR Eric Rivers to keep the game alive. Georgia Tech inched their way closer to a potential game-winning touchdown, making it as far as the BYU 18, but King threw an interception in the end zone on 4th down to seal the game. The drama in those last two drives was nothing short of impeccable\n\n###Prowling Pop-Tart\n\nSurrounding this hectic game was the ever-present insanity of giant Pop-Tarts mascots. The bowl took things up a notch this year by featuring six mascots. The mascots were broken up into two teams of three each, the “winning” team was chosen via online poll, and said team would be consumed by the champion of the bowl game.\n\nTeam Sprinkles, consisting of Protein Slammin' Strawberry, Frosted Cookies & Creme, and Frosted Cherry, won the poll. Just before the trio were dropped into the toaster to be cooked to perfection, in a twist worthy of Alfred Hitchcock, Strawberry jumped off of the toaster, ran out of the stadium, leaving only a cryptic sign behind: “You Haven’t Seen the Last of Me!”",

I was 1000% into mlb at that age, & I learned so much about the history of baseball & it's greatest players & stadiums through playing this game & looking info up in encyclopedias that I would pick up through playing. It let you simulate seasons & I think I got my love of tracking / learning statistics through this game, I had a binder where I would manually keep track of all kinds of stats & standings as I played. I created custom players using baseball card stats or newspaper stats & I sunk countless hours into this game. \n        \nI know I continued playing it for a few years & enjoyed it so much & I think it helped make me into the sports fan I am today.

        "selftext": "**The rules:** I'm fascinated by Simmons's incredulity regarding guessing the lines vs. Vegas so I'm putting it to the test this season in the \"this line is dumb\" feature. This year, I’ll be tracking when Simmons’s expected line is so far off from FanDuel’s and see who ended up being right ultimately. I’m only including games where Simmons expressed disagreement regarding the Vegas line and said something to that effect. The “I will be vindicated” line regarding KC and the Chargers is a perfect example. It’s usually a couple games per week but we’ll see.\n\nThe winner in Simmons vs. Vegas will be whoever is closer to the final result, tallied throughout the entire season. Before anyone chimes in with “well actually, the line is intended just to get even action on both sides,” I concede that point but this should something fun so don’t bother me with your perfectly valid logic.\n\nPrior results can be found [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/billsimmons/comments/1psqdy9/that_lines_dumb_week_16/)and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/billsimmons/comments/1pmpowm/that_lines_dumb_week_15/).\n\nOnto week 17 where we had a slate of Christmas Day games, Saturday games, and Sunday matchups that basically gave me a second job during the Christmas holiday week. Please forgive any typos or other BS mistakes as it was a week of travel for me. Separately, I think this NFL season might have broken Simmons when you read his week 17 commentary (little fight, just resignation). Also, I'm including some no-bets here because although he was off Vegas's line, he failed to argue against it (hence my concern that he maybe broken).\n\n/\n\n* Game: Cowboys @ Commanders\n* Simmons guess: Cowboys by 1.5\n* Vegas line: Cowboys by 5.5\n* Simmons commentary: \\[hears line\\] \"Really?\" \"Why is that line so high? Isn't Mariota playing?... Is Josh Johnson actually starting? I just thought Mariota left the game. He's not going to play this week?\" \\[Sal proceeds to ask what the injury was\\] \"I don't know. I'm going to look this up. I probably should have been more prepared.\" \n* Result: Cowboys by 5\n* Winner: Vegas\n* Discussion: The line closed at Cowboys by 8.5 once we knew that the Immaculate Grid cheat code Josh Johnson was, in fact, starting. I don't even know how to talk about this game since Simmons thought Mariota was starting. Since I was traveling this holiday season, I only saw part of this game via tablet from a hotel room (felt very Simmonsesque with my non-typical screen watching) while my wife was getting ready. From what I saw, it looked like Cowboys had this game in hand at halftime. I can't say Johnson played well, but he did play way better than what followed him (Goff). Still, the Commanders made the game respectable but Cowboys held on to win by 7 so Vegas won (I think they came prepared).\n\n/\n\n* Game: Lions @ Vikings\n* Simmons guess: Lions by 2.5\n* Vegas line: Lions by 5.5\n* Simmons commentary: \"Wow, I'm a mess.\" \"I like the Vikings. The Lions couldn't stop anything today. You gave up 230 yards rushing.\"\n* Result: Vikings by 13\n* Winner: Simmons\n* Discussion: The line closed at Lions by 7. Jesus, just what was that? All I saw from this game was just awful QB play. Goff, I expected better of you. Five turnovers? There were young children at our family gathering watching that and some of them may have lost money on a three-leg parlay involving Goff passing TDs. Brosmer was only marginally better although the weird \"fumble the ball as you throw it\" trick did entertain the young ones. The depleted Lions D, which gave up 158 rushing yards, can't really be accused of not stopping anyone despite giving up 23 points, considering their QB was sabotaging the team. Simmons read the game wrong but he still wins because of Goff.\n\n/\n\n* Game: Broncos @ Chiefs\n* Simmons guess: Broncos by 9.5\n* Vegas line: Broncos by 12.5\n* Simmons commentary: \"Oh man, I'm getting smoked.\"\n* Result: Broncos by 7\n* Winner: No bet\n* Discussion: The line closed at Vegas by 13.5 prior to kickoff. I didn't count this game because Bill didn't say the line was wrong, just that he was getting smoked. Simply being off the Vegas line without saying Vegas was wrong or putting up an argument as to why you should be right doesn't count, according to the rules. As a result, I don't think I saw more than a couple minutes of this game as Christmas movies dominated the TV programming. From reading the game recap, the Broncos won on a late Nix TD pass against the Chiefs who I thought mailed in the season a week ago against the Titans. I guess I have to give the Chiefs credit for putting up a fight, but the tight final score will only lead Simmons to profess how much he can't wait to bet against Nix in the playoffs. \n\n/\n\n* Game: Seahawks @ Panthers\n* Simmons guess: Seahawks by 3\n* Vegas line: Seahawks by 7.5\n* Simmons commentary: \"I have been off like this all year. That's four games now that I've been off by 4 points.\" \"Why would that be 7.5? It's in Carolina though. Do you agree with that? Sam Darnold laying 7.5 points in Carolina, and that passes the sniff test for you?\"\n* Result: Seahawks by 17\n* Winner: Vegas\n* Discussion: I'm not sure what stage of gambling depression/grief it is where you admit you've been off badly this year and week and you're asking your co-host for validation on another bad guess. Is that the equivalent of bargaining, but for line picking? Honestly, Simmons from 15 years ago would have penned a 7 Stages of Gambling Grief bit and had examples from his own life to match each stage. Maybe he has and I've simply forgotten it. If so, apologies to Bill. As for the game, the line closed at Seahawks by 7 because Vegas--like me--thinks the Panthers and their diminutive QB are doing this via smoke and mirrors. Smoke and mirrors proved to be an apt analogy because this game was basically played in a Brigadoon fog that descended on Charlotte and somehow transported both offenses' play back to 1897 in the first half. The second half was less morose but still ugly. Nonetheless, the Seahawks pulled away thanks to a facemask call and Bryce looking tiny as he faced a torrent of pass rushers late in the fourth quarter. The Seahawks tacked on a late TD after Carolina TO'ed on downs to hand the victory to Vegas over Simmons.\n\n/\n\n* Game: Jaguars @ Colts\n* Simmons guess: Jags by 4\n* Vegas line: Jags by 6.5\n* Simmons commentary: \"Oh wow... they're just jacking everybody up.\" \"That's pretty high, I think, because there's a chance the Colts could be good tomorrow, and then you'll feel like 'all right, Colts at home.'\"\n* Result: Jags by 6\n* Winner: Vegas\n* Discussion: The line closed at Jags by 4. For reference, the Colts lost by 21 the previous week to the Niners so the chance the Colts would be good should be discounted. However, the line did, in fact, move in favor of the Colts so Simmons was right in that regard and Vegas collectively said \"all right, Colts at home.\" Prior to the game, the Colts were eliminated from the playoffs so credit to them for at least showing up and trying vs. the Jags. If the Jags were a team Simmons liked, this would be described as a Milton Berle game, pulling out just enough to win. Since his conversion to Trevor-truther status is still in progress, he may just say it was a divisional game and the Colts showed heart. That said, the Jags opted for a FG at the end that meant those with the 4-point line won due to a late cover (a late Riley Leonard Hail Mary failed; I assume Rivers said he was going out for some smokes and never came back). Plus, it meant the 6-point difference was closer to Vegas's initial call than Simmons was so Vegas wins.\n\n/\n\n* Game: Bengals @ Cardinals\n* Simmons guess: Bengals by 4.5\n* Vegas line: Bengals by 6.5\n* Simmons commentary: \"Wow, I'm just awful.\" \n* Result: Bengals by 23\n* Winner: No bet\n* Discussion: Again, I can't count this game since self-flagellation alone does not meet the rules. After hearing him call himself just awful, I'm kinda getting worried for Simmons and his self-confidence. He really needs to regain that edge in time for the playoffs. As a non-gambling expert, I assumed Bengals by a touchdown sounded about right and that's where the line closed prior to kickoff (Bengals by 7). With their season over, the Bengals's offense unleashed hell upon the Cardinals and it was over by halftime.\n\n/\n\n* Game: Jaguars @ Colts\n* Simmons guess: Jags by 4\n* Vegas line: Jags by 6.5\n* Simmons commentary: \"Oh wow... they're just jacking everybody up.\" \"That's pretty high, I think, because there's a chance the Colts could be good tomorrow, and then you'll feel like 'all right, Colts at home.'\"\n* Result: Jags by 6\n* Winner: Vegas\n* Discussion: The line closed at Jags by 4.

I'm just getting.... it's like I'm the Chiefs. I've completely fallen apart. I used to be a dynasty.\" \"But the Giants were terrible today. They couldn't even throw the ball. Dart had 2 yards at halftime.\"\n* Result: Giants by 24\n* Winner: Vegas\n* Discussion:  The line closed at Giants by 3. For the record, Dart threw for 134 yards in the first half as the Giants raced out to a 17-3 lead. For the non-analytics types, that's an improvement of 132 yards week over week. The rest of the game was equally glum for the Raiders who failed to give Geno Smith a revenge game. Points go to Vegas (the gamblers, not this godawful team) for this laugher. Simmons's line-picking dynasty continues to collapse like ancient Rome.\n\n/\n\n* Simmons weekly record: 1-4 (with 2 no bets)\n* Simmons season record: 15-29-1 (counting last week's Simmons loss on the Niners after reconsideration)\n\n/  \nOnto week 18. Afterward I hope to do a season recap (teams Simmons loved/hated, best/worst call, Simmons blind spots, Simmons's cockiest statements that backfired) as a separate post so we can enjoy another regular season finale.",
