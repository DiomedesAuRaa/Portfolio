        "title": "[OC] Based on Dr. Pepper's Fansville ads, are there actually a \"State\" and \"Tech\" school that are major rivals?",

        "selftext": "By this point we all know the Dr. Pepper Fansville ads pitting two rival schools simply called State and Tech against one another.  This got me thinking, are there two ACTUAL States and Techs in the same state that are major rivals?  The results of my \"far too much time wasted\" research are below:\n\n**Alabama**: Alabama State is an FCS school, Alabama Tech does not exist.  \n**Alaska**: Neither Alaska State or Alaska Tech are real schools.  \n**Arizona**: Arizona State is in the Big XII, Arizona Tech does not exist.  \n**Arkansas**: Arkansas State is a G5 school, Arkansas Tech is a D2 team with a very unique set of nicknames (Wonder Boys for men’s sports, Golden Suns for women’s sports)  \n**California**: oh boy this is a wild one.  So there are 26 California States that exist, spread out across multiple divisions.  California Tech is D3 school, idk if they are rivals with any of the Cal States.   \n**Colorado**: Colorado State is in the reborn Pac12. Colorado Tech is a for-profit school in Colorado Springs, I don’t think they have athletics.   \nConnecticut: There’s a Connecticut State *Community College*, but no 4-year regular CSU.  There are a few directional Connecticut states but I’m not counting them.   Connecticut Tech does not exist.  \n**Delaware**: Delaware State is an FCS HBCU.  Like Connecticut, there is  Delaware Tech *Community College*, but no 4-year regular school.  \n**Florida**: Florida State is in the ACC.  Florida Tech is a D2 school.   \n**Georgia**: Georgia State and Georgia Tech are both located in Atlanta.  Despite being in the same city, they have only played once; in 2024, a 35-12 Tech victory.   \n**Hawai’i**: Neither Hawai’i State or Hawai’i Tech exist.    \n**Idaho**: Idaho State is in the FCS’ Big Sky Conference, Idaho Tech does not exist.  \n**Illinois**: Illinois State is in the FCS’ Missouri Valley Conference, Illinois Tech is a small school in Division 3.  \n**Indiana**: Indiana State is in the FCS’ Missouri Valley Conference, Indiana Tech is a small private school in Fort Wayne, playing their athletics in the NAIA.  \n**Iowa**: Iowa State is in the Big XII, Iowa Tech does not exist.  \n**Kansas**: Kansas State is in the Big XII, Kansas Tech does not exist, despite there being a total of 8 schools there with “technical” in the name.  \n**Kentucky**: Kentucky State is a small HBCU in Division 2, there are a boat load of “Kentucky Community and Technical Colleges”, but no specific Kentucky Tech.  \n**Louisiana**: Louisiana State is in the SEC, Louisiana Tech is in Conference USA.  They have played a total of 21 times, with LSU winning 20 of the matchups.   \n**Maine**: Neither Maine State or Maine Tech exist.  \n**Maryland**: Fun fact, Maryland Eastern Shore *used* to be Maryland State, but they renamed themselves in 1970.  Maryland Tech does not exist.   \n**Massachusetts**: UMass is in the MAC, Massachusetts Tech is D3 in sports.  \n**Michigan**: Michigan State (Go Green) is in the Big Ten, Michigan Tech is a D2 school in the upper peninsula.  Although they don’t play in football, they do in hockey occasionally.  \n**Minnesota**: Minnesota State is a D2 team except in hockey where they are D1, there are many technical universities in Minnesota, but no specific “Minnesota Tech”.  \n**Mississippi**: Mississippi State, the *other* MSU, is in the SEC, Mississippi Tech does not exist.  Mississippi has a whopping 0 technical schools.   \n**Missouri**: Missouri State is in Conference USA, Missouri Tech does not exist, but they do have several technical schools.  \n**Montana**: Montana State, the FCS champs, are in the Big Sky, Montana Tech is a small NAIA school.  \n**Nebraska**: Neither Nebraska State or Nebraska Tech is a school that exists.  \n**Nevada**: Nevada State is real??  Apparently they do actually exist I was stunned by this.  Nevada Tech is not a real school however.   \n**New Hampshire**: Neither New Hampshire State or New Hampshire Tech is a real school.  \n**New Jersey**: New Jersey State ~~doesn’t exist~~ is part of the official name of Rutgers, I will include them on this, New Jersey Tech is real, but they don’t have a football team.  \n**New Mexico**: New Mexico State is in Conference USA, New Mexico Tech doesn’t exist as written, but there is a New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.   \n**New York**:  Oh lordy.  There are a million and a half New York States (known better as the SUNY system), New York Tech doesn’t exist as written, but there is a SUNY Tech in D3, and a New York *City* Tech in D3 as well.  I’m sure there is a rivalry between SUNY Tech and one of the other SUNY schools out there.   \n**North Carolina**: North Carolina State is in the ACC, North Carolina Tech doesn’t exist, but there are *many* 2-year tech schools in NC.   \n**North Dakota**: North Dakota State is an FCS powerhouse, North Dakota Tech doesn’t exist.   \n**Ohio**: Ohio State is a Big Ten team, Ohio Tech is a for-profit school in Cleveland apparently.  They have the shortest wiki page of any school I clicked on.   \n**Oklahoma**: Oklahoma State is in the Big XII, Oklahoma Tech doesn’t technically (haha) exist, but there *is* an Oklahoma State Tech that’s part of the OSU system.  \n**Oregon**: Oregon State is in the reborn Pac12, Oregon Tech is in the NAIA.   \n**Pennsylvania**: Penn State is in the Big Ten, Penn Tech is a very, **very** small junior college, whose mascot is apparently named Garri the Monster.  Huh.  \n**Rhode Island**: Rhode Island State doesn’t exist, Rhode Island Tech doesn’t either.  \n**South Carolina**: South Carolina State is an FCS HBCU, South Carolina Tech doesn’t exist as written, but there *are* a TON of schools in the South Carolina Technical College System.   \n**South Dakota**: South Dakota State is in the FCS' Missouri Valley, South Dakota Tech doesn't exist as written, but there is a South Dakota School of Mines and Technology in DII.  \n**Tennessee**: Tennessee State and Tennessee Tech are both in the same FCS conference, this might be the closest we get.  They have played 37 times with Tennessee State leading 22-17    \n**Texas**: Texas State is in the reborn Pac12, Texas Tech is in the Big XII.  They have only played 3 times, with the Red Raiders winning all 3.   \n**Utah**: Utah State is in the reborn Pac12, Utah Tech, formerly known as Dixie State, is in the FCS' United Athletic Conference.  \n**Vermont**: Vermont State exists, and is spread out over 5 different campuses.  Vermont Tech does not exist.  \n**Virginia**: Virginia State is a small HBCU in D2, Virginia Tech is in the ACC.   \n**Washington**: Washington State is in the reborn Pac12, Washington Tech I guess was a very short lived experiment, only existing from 2017 to 2022.   \n**West Virginia**: West Virginia State is a D2 team, West Virginia Tech is NAIA.  \n**Wisconsin**: Wisconsin State does not exist.  There is a *system* of Wisconsin Techs, but none that are specifically \"Wisconsin Tech\"   \n**Wyoming**: Wyoming State does not exist.  Wyoming Tech is a for-profit school in  Laramie.\n\ntl;dr: The only two State and Tech schools I can see having a rivalry are Tennessee Tech and Tennessee State.  Dr. Pepper has lied to us.  I think I need a drink.\n\nAlso let me know if there are any mistakes/forgotten teams.  I just went off of Wikipedia for schools.",

It would be cool to see him on the opposite side of Hutch, but the cap hit and draft capital we would have to give up to get him isn't worth it imo. We definitely need to improve our defensive front, but we aren't even going to sniff the postseason without improving the O-Line. ",

I know I don't *have* to, but the last couple of months and then especially after the Butler injury there's this sentiment amongst fans and some analysts of \"oh man, poor Steph, he doesn't get to end his career playing on a stacked team like he was used to.\"\n\nObviously the Warriors are going to try to get better and compete, and if Steph wants to ask for a trade that's fair too. I just don't understand this weeping that people, especially non-Warriors fans, are doing because he's on a team that might only make the playoffs this season.",
