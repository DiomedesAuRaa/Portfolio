Decisions on recruitment, spending and strategy sit with those clubs, within a financial framework designed to ensure sustainability and competitive balance. That framework applies equally across the league.”\n\n“Cristiano has been fully engaged with Al Nassr since his arrival and has played an important role in the club’s growth and ambition. Like any elite competitor, he wants to win. But no individual – however significant – determines decisions beyond their own club.”\n\n“Recent transfer activity demonstrates that independence clearly. One club strengthened in a particular way. Another chose a different approach. Those were club decisions, taken within approved financial parameters.”\n\n“The competitiveness of the league speaks for itself,” the league spokesperson added.\n\n“With only a few points separating the top four, the title race is very much alive. That level of balance reflects a system that is working as intended.”\n\n“The focus remains on football — on the pitch, where it belongs — and on maintaining a credible, competitive competition for players and fans.”",

Only 4* teams have ever won without pulling this off. Currently only OKC has met the standard this season. The following are the only teams who can still accomplish that this year:\n\nDetroit: 37-13\n\nSan Antonio: 35-16\n\nNew York: 33-18\n\nBoston: 33-18\n\nDenver 33-19\n\nHouston: 31-19\n\nLakers: 30-19\n\nRealistically, Detroit and SA are probably the only other two teams who can get there. Kind of wild to think about when you look back at where they were over the last few seasons.\n\nGood luck to your guys!\n\n*(edit: It was 4 teams)\n\n1994–95 Houston Rockets\n\n2003–04 Detroit Pistons\n\n2005–06 Miami Heat\n\n2020–21 Milwaukee Bucks",
