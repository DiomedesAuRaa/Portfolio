        "title": "Age-old questions on this sub: How long does Nebraska have to be down before they're no longer considered a blue blood? How long would LSU/Georgia/PSU have to remain top tier programs before people started considering them blue bloods?",
        "author": "goodnames679",
        "score": 373,
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1r48bop/ageold_questions_on_this_sub_how_long_does/",
        "selftext": "Historically when you ask this on this sub, the answer for the former is heavily debated and the answer for the latter is just \"you don't become a blue blood, you have to always be a top program across CFB history.\" However, that isn't really true, is it?\n\nIf you look at Nebraska before Devaney, what you see is a \"pretty good\" program. Nebraska wasn't considered a blue blood until they had one of the most impressive extended runs of any program ever between 1963 and 2001. In this 38-year span they had all 5 of their claimed national titles, an additional 6 unclaimed national championships, finished in the top-10 in 27 of those 38 seasons, and generally remained one of *the* premier programs. This run is what made Nebraska a blue blood, so nobody can really argue that a program can't *become* a blue blood. Any program with sufficiently strong history and a dominant enough run can eventually rack up numbers comparable to the existing blue bloods.\n\nWhat qualifies someone as a blue blood? Strong enough history that they can be considered strong across much of CFB's past, plenty of national titles, talent put into the NFL, and if you ask on this sub... [the chart](http://cfbcomparer.com/ap-poll-leaders). You can see that while Nebraska still has a decent gap over the next-best programs, there is still a very real possibility of who might pass them. Let's say that any program who passes Nebraska on all of these metrics has certifiably \"become\" a blue blood. \n\n\n**Georgia** is first up, as they're closer to surpassing Nebraska currently. \n\n* Georgia needs **one** more claimed national title to match Nebraska's 5, and two to surpass them. That seems very attainable given how strong the program is under Smart.\n\n* Georgia **already** surpasses Nebraska in both draft picks (22 more) and first-round draft picks (18 more)\n\n* Georgia needs **38** more ranked weeks to tie Nebraska. Given that Nebraska has finished unranked every season since 2012, this is easily attainable in 3, maybe 4 seasons depending on how Nebraska performs.\n\n* Georgia needs **83** more weeks ranked in the top 5 to tie Nebraska. Given that Georgia is fairly consistently in the top 5 under Kirby, and Nebraska does not seem to be returning to the top 5 anytime soon, this isn't actually that bad. This could theoretically be attained in the next 5 seasons, but to be conservative let's say 7. \n\nRealistically, if Kirby continues his current success and wins another title or two, Georgia should have every claim at having surpassed Nebraska in all the most relevant metrics by the time that 2033 rolls around. At that point, how does anyone say that Nebraska is a blue blood but Georgia is not? I'm not sure, honestly.\n\nSo what about **LSU**?\n\n* LSU **already** ties Nebraska in national titles, and could surpass them by winning one more. Given their hot streak this century and how well Lane Kiffin has done lately, I think the odds are pretty solid for them here.\n\n* LSU **already** surpasses Nebraska in draft picks (18 more) and first-round draft picks (19 more)\n\n* LSU needs **47** more ranked weeks to tie Nebraska. That could take as few as three seasons, but I assume Nebraska will spend more than a few weeks ranked so presumably this will take at least 4.\n\n* One big hurdle LSU has, however, is that they have fewer than *half* the weeks ranked in the top 5. That could be argued to be an arbitrary metric by some, but I think it does speak a lot when a program is able to sustain that high level of success for a lot of time. LSU would have to be ranked in the top 5 for an additional **156** weeks to tie Nebraska, the equivalent of over 9 full seasons in the top 5. Under a dynasty this is technically attainable in the next ~15 years, but realistically I don't think LSU can surpass Nebraska here until ~20-30 years out.\n\nLSU can pass Nebraska in most metrics in the next few years, but in order to surpass them in all metrics they'll be held back by their lack of top-5 ranked weeks for a long time. Still, within 20-30 years they will quite possibly surpass Nebraska on all fronts.\n\nAnd... **Penn State**? Are you serious OP?\n\n* Actually yeah. Penn State currently ties Georgia in titles, meaning they're only **1** title away from tying Nebraska. Given how close they've been to breaking through recently, the right coach could certainly take them there.\n\n* And yet again, Penn State **already** surpasses Nebraska with draft picks (24 more) and first-round draft picks (10 more)\n\n* Penn State needs only **16** weeks ranked to surpass Nebraska in that metric. That will be the first time since the creation of this website that any program has passed a blue blood in \"the chart,\" and realistically it probably happens in the 2027-2028 season. \n\n* Penn State is also a lot closer than LSU in terms of weeks in the top 5 - needing **109** weeks in the top 5 to surpass Nebraska. That is still the equivalent of over 6 full seasons, but given that Penn State has regularly hit the top 5 recently during the season I think they could accomplish this before LSU does. \n\nI think some people will be surprised at how much Penn State is on the cusp of pulling this off, given that most probably rate the job as a tier below Georgia/LSU right now. They may lack a very-recent title, but Penn State still has a long history of success that has them right in this discussion.\n\n---\n\nAll this... *except*...\n\nThere is one metric that Nebraska still far and away dog-walks these programs in. Conference Championships\n\nNebraska: 46\n\nGeorgia: 17\n\nLSU: 16\n\nPenn State: 4\n\nThe question is really how much you value this as a metric. Can you really be a blue blood if you don't dominate your opposition? But then again - Penn State spent most of its history as independent. If ND can be a blue blood without conference championships, surely another program could. It's also debatable whether being in a stronger conference should hold you back, as if LSU/Georgia have a similar historical level of success in everything *except* conference championships they certainly have a strong argument.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Are we on the cusp of seeing the first changes in the blue blood list in most of our lifetimes? Or is Nebraska simply at risk of falling off without any other programs joining quite yet?",

Then the electric engine shut off and they were driving cars with 500hp. Less power than LMP2. On Le Mans, driving through the pits saved enough energy to reach 30km/h more on the next straight than going through the start / finish line.\n\nBy then, no LMP1 driver complained.

        "selftext": "With the NFL draft approaching, I, like most of you, start digging deep into players. We identify the Lions' needs, read about the prospects, track combine results, follow pro days and visits, and F5 the rumor mill as the day approaches.\n\nIn that process, it's natural to have players you prefer. The draft is like Christmas - we all have our wish lists and toys that we hope to get. But keep in mind one important thing:\n\nYou have zero input.\n\nI know that seems snide, and obvious. But these next couple months are going to be an endless stream of people \"convinced\" that the Lions' best pick would be Draft Crush X, or that they absolutely have to draft Position Y, or that they should execute Pick Trade Z. The reality, though is this: \n\nYou don't know shit.\n\nAnd hey, neither do I. It kinda sucks to admit. Part of being a fan is feeling like you're part of the team. It's the illusion they sell you, the booze they feed you.\n\nBut you're not.\n\nWe don't have access to their scouting reports. We don't talk to players' coaches and teammates. 99% of us do the same research everyone else is doing, which is just listening to self-proclaimed draft experts. But all that most of those guys have done is watch a few highlights, take a few bribes from agents and publicists, and then regurgitate what all of the other experts are saying.\n\nIt's fun. I won't deny that. I do it for a reason.\n\nBut we don't know shit. And the \"experts\" only have passing familiarity with shit.\n\nSo go ahead and figure out what your personal draft board is - which you realistically probably only spent a dozen hours or so on - because it's enjoyable. And go ahead and figure out what order they need to take the various positions, because that's a fun puzzle as well.\n\nBut if Holmes trades up in round 1 for TE Kenyon Sadiq, don't say I didn't warn you.",
