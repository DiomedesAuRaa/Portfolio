        "selftext": "Hey folks, following up on [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1pq163i/i_made_a_dumb_tool_to_determine_the_best_cfb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) last month about a dumb game that pops up two helmets and users vote which one they like better.\n\n[https://www.fantasygenius.io/college-helmet-battle](https://www.fantasygenius.io/college-helmet-battle)\n\nAfter a shocking number of votes (over 194,000!), we have some initial results!\n\nHere are the top 10 helmets and their win rates:\n\n1. Georgia Tech *Pop-Tart Sprinkles* (84%)\n2. BYU *Pop-Tart Sprinkles* (79%)\n3. Arizona State *2011-2019* (79%)\n4. Navy *2012 Anchor* (78%)\n5. USF *2011-2013* (76%)\n6. Wyoming *2022-2023* (76%)\n7. SMU *2008-2011* (76%)\n8. FSU *1976-2013* (75%)\n9. Arizona State *1996-2010* (75%)\n10. Tulane *1998-2013* (75%)\n\n**Dumb guy analysis**\n\nThe people yearn for sprinkles on helmets.\n\n5 of the top 10 helmets have some kind of stabbing instrument. Two tridents ([ASU](https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/30/604/full/arizona_state_sun_devils_logo_helmet_20117218.png)), one set of horns ([USF](https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/34/837/full/south_florida_bulls_logo_helmet_20115779.png)), one spear ([FSU](https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/31/679/full/5051.gif)), and one anchor ([Navy](https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/33/765/full/2736_navy_midshipmen-helmet-2012.png)...what is an anchor if not a way to stab the sea floor?) \n\nI suspect we'll see [UVA](https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/35/898/full/5334.gif) continue to climb the rankings, given that their helmets have two stabbing instruments. \n\nHorses are also popular, with [Wyoming](https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/35/918/full/wyoming_cowboys_logo_helmet_20225906.png) and [SMU](https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/34/842/full/2795_southern_methodist_mustangs-helmet-0.png) ranking highly. Crucially, both of these helmets have the entire horse featured on the helmet. [Boise State](https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/30/617/full/boise_state_broncos_logo_helmet_2012_sportslogosnet-1364.png), for example, has a horse but it's only the head/neck area. For any helmet designers, the people want to see the horse's ass.\n\nThe bottom helmet is the [LSU 1972-1976](https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/32/723/full/6177_lsu_tigers-helmet-1972.png) helmet with a win rate of just 13%. I suspect there's some vote brigading happening here because I personally think this helmet is pretty sick. But maybe I just have bad opinions. \n\nMy only personal disappointment is North Texas having just a 50% win rate. Look at [this page](https://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/782/North-Texas-Mean-Green-Logos/)...every single one of these helmets and logos is great. Show some damn respect.\n\nThanks to the great website [sportslogos.net](http://sportslogos.net) for supplying all of these helmets for us to look through!",

Once he arrived in Chicago though, there's nothing forgettable at all about the way he's played. He's better on defense than people give him credit for, is still a huge threat from the 3pt line and is great at cutting. I was actually pissed when the Bulls got him back in their LaVine trade with the Kings as I thought Huerter was washed and was called him Red Bricks instead of Red Velvet, but he's won me over to the point where I want him in Chicago long term.
