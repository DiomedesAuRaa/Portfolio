In nearly every other esport if a team starts playing a certain way then there’s a plethora of options through weapons, skills, abilities, or even map functionality to counter it. Yet cod is the only one I can think of where people would even consider limiting a mode to being played a certain way strategically because the game in its current state is just so one dimensional that players can’t even do anything to counter a strategy.",
