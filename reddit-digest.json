        "selftext": "If you just look at Diego Pavia without the personality and antics:\n\n* Zero D1 offers, only two D2 offers out of high school\n* Played at a community college and transferred to New Mexico State, which is a historically bad program that is 5th worst all-time in win percentage\n* Led them to their first double-digit win season since 1960\n* Transferred to Vanderbilt, another historically bad program that is bottom 30 all-time in win percentage, 7th worst all-time for Power 5, and worst all-time in the SEC\n* Leads them to their first winning season in a decade, then their first double-digit win season in history. \n* Plays some genuinely good and exciting football with a fun to watch playstyle. Heisman runner-up\n* Is 5'9, scrappy, and would be the shortest QB to ever play in the NFL\n\nHe would have been the biggest slam-dunk, easy-to-root-for underdog ever if he wasn't such an ass. You literally could not write a better underdog story if you tried. And nobody hated Vanderbilt as a program either, they would've been as universally well-liked as Indiana if Pavia had even been half the man that Fernando is. Absolutely generational fumble tbh. ",

I’m still learning the game of Baseball, and I love it, maybe even more than Basketball, never been more enamored with a sport in a while, and that’s why I wanna root for a historically piss-poor team.\n\nWhy? ‘Coz I kinda like that struggle and slowly learn, and hopefully see a team gradually win and improve, as weird as it seems, and I don’t live in the US (or Canada) and cant really cheer for a state/city/. So, whichever metric or category you choose, whether its statistically or your own opinion, who’s like the most consistently disappointing, trash fire at worst, mediocre at best franchise in the history of the MLB?\n\nEdit: Decision made. \n\nFirst of all, thanks for the answers, everyone here is super friendly, joining this sub here for sure.\n\nLos Angeles Angels it is. I was a Lakers fan through the Kobe-Gasol era, and the Josh McRoberts era of the team. The Lakers are my team but I somehow really hate them, I think thats just part of rooting for an LA team, in this case, im rooting for the MLB equivalent of the Clippers.\n\nI saw that the Angels spend big hoping to get somewhere just by doing that and getting mad it doesnt work, reminds me of the mid-2010s NBA LA teams.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, the Rockies were a good choice for exactly what i said in the post, but I may have underestimated the kind of pain I was willing to endure when I saw all your comments about them, I’mma need a very tiny bit of hope, even just a spec.\n\nAngels it is.\n\nEdit 2: Sorry, guys, Angels win. The Mariners look promising and the Rockies scare me. Also, I’ve changed my flair and my favorite team on The Show to the Angels, so there’s no going back. 🫡",

Trump makes sporadic appearances but is basically a side character.\n\nIf you've ever seen one of those \"produced by the subject\" documentaries on Netflix, you've seen this flick.\n\nLots of meetings with other First Ladies of the world.\n\n8/10 overall.
