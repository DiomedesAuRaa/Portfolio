        "selftext": "Per the below quote from Sac State’s president, Sac State is planning to “primarily“ fund their advancement to FBS with game guarantees.\n\n  \n“All of this is being primarily paid for by game guarantees. As an FBS school, we can get $1 million to $1.5 million per game.\n\n[https://statehornet.com/2026/02/sacramento-state-football-mid-american-conference-fbs-fcs-president-luke-wood/](https://statehornet.com/2026/02/sacramento-state-football-mid-american-conference-fbs-fcs-president-luke-wood/)\n\n  \nHowever, this makes no financial sense. First of all, let’s talk about the costs they've agreed to \n\n\\- $18 million to MAC \n\n\\- $5 million to NCAA for FBS Advancement \n\n\\- All travel for away teams (let’s assume $500k/game at four games a year) = $10 million over 5 years \n\n\\- Immediate upgrades to Hornet Stadium (let’s assume $5 million total) \n\n\\- All conference disbursements. In 2022, the Big Sky gave Sac State about $450k in disbursements. To keep the numbers clean, let’s assume $200k of that is for football so 1 million over 5 years. \n\nTOTAL = $39 million over 5 years or 7.8 million a year \n\nThe MAC has 8 conference games, let’s assume they don’t go to 9 which is the trend amongst FBS conferences. So, they have 4 available games a year to make back these costs. \n\nLet’s also completely disregard any game guarantees Sac State would/already will receive at the FCS level. For example, Oregon State is paying them $600k for a game in 2029 but we’ll forget about that. \n\nSo, utilizing the 4 remaining games each year, Sac State would need to bring in almost 2 million a game to fund these costs with game guarantees. As far as I can tell, no P4 team has ever paid 2 million dollars for a game guarantee (record is 1.9 million for WKU @ Auburn) , but we’ll assume Sac State is such a lucrative program that they found them. That once again assumes the following - \n\n\\- Sac State is playing 4 away guarantee games, meaning they’ll only have 4 home games and hence lose 1/3 of their home game revenue, but we’ll disregard that. \n\n\\- Sac State is likely starting the season 0-4 having played P4 programs to start the season. This is not a way to drum up interest and sell tickets for your 4 home games. \n\n\\- Sac State is finding 4 guarantee games despite the new 10 game P4 requirements in the P4 leagues limiting the number of guarantee games. \n\n\\- Sac State is not purchasing any guarantee games themselves versus their rivals UC Davis or bringing in “bigger“ names like Fresno State or Nevada to drum up ticket sales. \n\n\\- Not accounting for additional costs in a new stadium which is apparently still happening. \n\n  \nLet‘s even take a “reasonable” approach of the following - \n\n\\- Sac State books two guarantee games at $2 million total a year total. \n\n\\- Sac State spends $500k on guarantee games versus an FBS team. \n\n\\- Sac State increases football revenues from $4 to $6 million per year with the FBS competition. This means they’re making about as much money as San Jose State. SJSU’s revenue includes guarantees so technically we’re doubling up but whatever it doesn’t work anyways. \n\n  \nHence, they’re generating about $3.5 million / year in additional revenue or almost $20 million short over the span of 5 years. \n\n  \nThe thought of course is that they needed an escape hatch to FBS. Now that they have it, it’s easier to be flexible from here. For a publicly funded university already facing budget issues though, it seems incredibly irresponsible to take this risk when the justified funding mechanism is so easily debunked. \n\nYou could also hope that the donors step up, however with the new stadium, new downtown campus, big NIL expenditures, and flashy coach hires, it seems like their donors will too end up overcommitted. \n\n The MAC better hope their check clears! \n\n",

        "selftext": "People know the Big Ten and SEC are looking to expand again between, likely sometime between 2030 and 2035. People say that’s bad for the Big 12 and ACC because their top teams will get raided. But here’s my question: it would certainly be bad for the ACC, but would it really be bad for the Big 12?\n\nWhen I hear about the teams the Power Two might actually be interested in, it’s always the top teams in the ACC and never anyone from the Big 12. There seems to be legitimate interest between both the Big Ten and the SEC and the top four brands from the ACC (Clemson, Florida State, Miami, and North Carolina). Georgia Tech and Virginia seem like longer shots than those four but I’ve even heard there’s potential interest there as well.\n\nHowever, I’ve heard nothing about the Power Two being interested in any Big 12 teams. Texas Tech and Baylor would make sense for the SEC at least geographically, but I see no reason the SEC would want either team unless \\*maybe\\* they somehow lost out on \\*all\\* the top ACC teams to the Big Ten. The only Big 12 teams I’ve even seen tied to the Power Two was an article about the Big Ten potentially wanting Utah, but I think that was the author’s opinion and not an actual rumor. And I think the commenters on that article rightly pointed out that if the Big Ten really wanted Utah, they would have invited them in the first place instead of letting them go to the Big 12. In fact, I think the Big 12 might even benefit from the ACC getting raided by the Power Two because teams like Louisville and Pitt might decide they’re better off in the Big 12 than a watered down ACC without their top brands.\n\nSo while power two expansion will certainly be bad for the ACC, will it be good or bad for the Big 12?",

        "selftext": "Basically, the system explained simply as I can is:\n\n1) Everyone who misses the playoffs gets the same amount of tickets. Once you’re eliminated, losing extra games gives you nothing extra. So there’s no reason to tank after you’re clearly out. \n\n2) Tickets roll over (“carry over”) If you don’t win a top pick this year, you keep your tickets and add more next year. So a team that’s been bad for years slowly builds a huge pile of tickets and eventually becomes very likely to win. \n\n3) Winning resets or reduces your tickets To keep it fair: If you win the #1 pick, your tickets reset to 0. If you win #2/#3/#4, your ticket stash gets cut down by a big percentage. If you do well in the playoffs, your ticket stash also gets reduced (because you’re clearly not weak). \n\nSo COLA rewards teams that are: bad for a long time, and/or unlucky in past lotteries\n\nWhy this reduces tanking: Before you’re eliminated, you still want to win to make the playoffs. After you’re eliminated, you can’t improve your odds by losing more. So tanking doesn’t help teams.\n\nHere's the full proposal: [https://arxiv.org/html/2602.02487v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.02487v1)",

The original point of giving the worst teams the highest pick (then changed to best odds of highest pick) was to help bring them back to relevance. This is too exploitable for tanking, but a less-exploitable version should be in place.\n\n2. If all non-playoff teams get the same lotto odds, you incentivize low-end playoff teams to tank into the lotto. All lotto teams would have a 7.1% chance of winning the top pick, and a 21.4% chance to get a top 3, both of which are remarkably better than for a typical 8 seed to win the title. So now you changed who tanks, and it's arguably worse for above .500 teams to throw games than bad teams who were going to lose 50+ games anyway.",
