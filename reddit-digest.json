That’s the zone where my reactions snap, my aim is sharp, and I’m decent. Without that intensity, I can’t compete in ranked or 8s. \n\nWhen I was younger, I could stay in that “sweat mode” for hours straight. Now? Played two Zoomaa 8s series and I’m laying in bed feeling like Might Guy after opening the 8 gates. \n\nMy hands hurt, my neck is stiff, I’m drenched in sweat with wet spots on my chair.\n\nAnyone else relate? \n\nIs there anyway I learn to shoot back without having to subject body myself to this?",

I’m hearing fans and media say the expectation is the playoff but have you looked at that schedule next year? They could easily have a better team and win less games than this year. The schedule this year was a dream, basically 3 tough games. Next year they’ve got Oklahoma, Indiana, Penn State, @ Oregon, @ Ohio State. Even Iowa and @ Minnesota are tricky. Regardless of where you fall on the coaching hire, seems like expectations need to be tempered.  I think 8-9 wins is where I’d predict and that likely doesn’t get you in. ",

He comes in, spaces the floor, pressures the ball, and doesn’t need the offense run for him to contribute.\n\nWhat really stands out is how natural he looks in the role. He’s decisive, plays under control, and doesn’t hijack possessions. That’s exactly what you want next to Cade or running the second unit.",

Not to mention a bunch of the supporting characters (who are there specifically TO be spent as stakes-raising capital). hell, this pic is missing Will, Joyce, Dustin, Steve, Jonathan, Holly, and Nancy, too!\n\nShow just completely disappeared up its own ass starting in Season 3, and lost all control of what it was trying to be. It became a clumsy (and overly precious, on top of that) pastiche of Marvel/Superhero storytelling in cheap 80s drag, and not any kind of King/Spielberg/Carpenter homage anymore.\n\nThe most 80s thing about it is that it got dumber, worse, and more expensive as it kept going, and then went long past the point of it ever hoping to be good again. Like it started as a prestige tribute to Amblin/Universal suburban fantasy - and now it's basically a Golan/Globus - Cannon Films co-production, only with Marvel Money behind it (instead of getting its budget slashed last second.)\n\nThat sucks.",

I'm sure Bill took a victory lap when the NBA Cup was first announced, I just haven't looked for the receipts.\n\nThe conversation starts around the 10 minute mark.\n\nAlso, the same hits of \"the season is too long\" and \"tanking\" being an issue are discussed, although \"tanking\" as the term had not entered our sports lexicon in 2009.\n\nOther notes:\nIn a 2012 pod with Klosterman, Bill mentions the future of \"internet in cars\" and throwing on Pandora for music. Klosterman mentions he prefers Spotify lol",
