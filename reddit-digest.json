        "selftext": "The more I look at this class, the more I think Brad picks an edge in round 1. I think of the 3 biggest needs (T, C/G, DE)  only 2 of them are worth addressing with a 1st round pick (T, DE) and only 1 of them has actual 1st round talent this year. \n\nThis is a very weak tackle class. I think Lions fans are falling in love with Proctor out of Alabama. Don’t. You see the guy lead blocking on a screen pass and you think, wow he’s huge and he’s athletic. That’s all you need to start campaigning for Brad Holmes to make that guy a Lion. He’s not the player you think he is. He’s slow out of his stance, his technique as a pass blocker is bad, he’s overly reliant on his size, his feet are god awful, and he consistently gives up inside rushing lanes, which wouldn’t be such a problem but he’s not quick enough to consistently recover and put himself back in the path of the rusher.\n\nThe Utah tackles are not great prospects either. Both of them lack lower body strength and it’s very evident in one aspect of their game. Weirdly enough they’re the exact opposite of eachother. Fanu is a great run blocker, there’s plays he can body two guys at once, but he’s a horrible pass blocker. You can’t help but think god damn he’s skinny when he’s attempting to stop pass rushers. His lower body strength in pass pro is desperate. Lomu on the other hand is a poor run blocker, he doesn’t finish blocks, he plays with zero leverage and he leans into guys, he regularly gets himself tossed around. As a pass blocker he’s solid, not other worldly, but solid enough. He plays with a good base, sets an anchor and keeps his feet apart. \n\nMauigoa out of Miami will probably end up being the first tackle off the board because I don’t think he’s got as many holes in his games, he’s just not consistent yet nor would I consider him a blue chip talent. He’s solid as both a run blocker and a pass blocker but there are still inconsistencies. His base as a pass blocker can be hit or miss and he touches his heels together from time to time, and he leans allot as a run blocker..\n\nOn the other side of the ball, I think there are several edge prospects worth discussing as first round picks. 7 to be exact. I think 3 of those guys are can’t miss prospects for this class, I think 1 is a 3rd down specialist that offers more upside on a limited snap count than any of the tackles offer playing a full game, and I think the other 3 prospects are solid. \n\n",

We were getting layups and dunks all fucking night and the announcers still tried to spin our FG% into a positive for the Lakers. \n\nAbsolutely loved our defense making lebron look washed af on his birthday too lol. \n\nHappy new year gents ",
