        "selftext": ">It’s amazing how much has changed in three years. Think back to the 2022 NBA All-Star Game: Three precocious young point guards — the Atlanta Hawks’ Trae Young, the Memphis Grizzlies’ Ja Morant and the Charlotte Hornets’ LaMelo Ball — made the squad and played on the same team in Cleveland.\n\n>In each case, the future for both player and team seemed bright, but fast forward to 2025, and that’s not the case. Young’s Hawks made the Eastern Conference finals in 2021, Ball’s Hornets won 43 games in 2022 and Morant’s Grizzlies were the second seed in the Western Conference in consecutive seasons. Unbelievably, none of the three have won a playoff series since 2022. This doesn’t look like the year the streak will end, with the Hawks and Grizzlies in Play-In territory and Ball’s Hornets again headed for the draft lottery.\n\n>Similarly, all three have seen their career trajectories go sideways, even if it’s happened more in slow motion than in one rapid swoon. Injuries have plagued all three, but unserious defense and stalled development trajectories are also to blame. Ball has been the topic of trade rumors and even a rumored trade demand; Young is a potential free agent this summer whose team has made no serious move toward extending his contract; Morant’s unreliability was a key factor in Memphis’ offseason reset, and he’s already been suspended by his own team this season.\n\n>There might be other individual players who have been more disappointing this season, but as a class, the Southern point guard trio has moved into a league of its own. As a result, those three top my All-Disappointment Team for 2025-26.\n\n>My squad is a list of players who have done the most to fall short of our hopes and expectations, however misplaced they might have been. While I focused more on significant players on big contracts, I sprinkled in a few middle-class guys and developmental cases as well.\n\n>We’re barely one-third of the way into an 82-game season. Things can and do change, and inevitably, some players will play themselves off this list. But as 2026 begins, here are the envelopes. (Stats as of Wednesday afternoon.)\n\n**NBA All-Disappointment Team:**\n\n- Ja Morant\n- LaMelo Ball\n- Trae Young\n- Darius Garland\n- Paolo Banchero\n- Draymond Green\n- Jared McCain\n- Herb Jones\n- Cam Johnson\n- Guerschon Yabusele\n- Indiana’s Youth\n\n\nSource: https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6930954/2026/01/01/nba-season-2025-2026-disappointments/",

James was the most-viewed NBA player on social media last season. But on Dec. 23, he dropped to fourth behind Doncic, San Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama and Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry on an NBA list of the 10 most-viewed players this season.\n\nPerhaps James is lagging behind because he missed training camp and the start of the season with sciatica. What’s worth noting is that James’ biggest historical rival, Michael Jordan, had a drop from All-Star grace at the end of his career, too.\n\nAt 39, Jordan wasn’t voted by fans as an Eastern Conference All-Star starter during his 2002-03 swan song season. East All-Star coach Isiah Thomas encouraged a willing Vince Carter to give up his starting spot to Jordan during the 2003 NBA All-Star Game. Jordan, then playing for the Washington Wizards, was celebrated during a halftime performance by legendary singer Mariah Carey.\n\nUnlike Jordan, it’s uncertain if this will be James’ last NBA season. There is certainly nothing more for James to accomplish. He is the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, a four-time NBA champion, and his son, Bronny, is also in the league.\n\n\nSource: https://andscape.com/features/is-lebron-james-nba-all-star-game-voting-a-sign-of-the-times/\n\n",

Aero was really coming in, and the Lotus 49 was using a rear wing raised way up high, on these spindly supports (think kind of like a Top Fuel dragster). And the supports were attached to the suspension, instead of the body, so the wing would actually move around.  \n\nDuring a race, one of them broke off Jochen Rindt's car, and he crashed. The setup was blamed, and thereafter, the rule was changed so wings had to be attached to the body. (It didn't help that Colin Chapman had a reputation for building cars so light that they posed a hazard to his drivers.)\n\nI'm sure some people already know this, but it was new to me, so I thought I'd post.

He answers a lot of the concerns the team has right which, the need of a true secondary ball handler/ #2 option, natural 3pt shooter, someone who can reliably create their own shot outside of Cade, and also can take some of the focus away from Cade. Again it's only a two game sample size but in those two games he's played either less than or slightly more than Robinson and put up 19pts and 18pts respectively. I think tonight he had 18/2/4 with 2 steals? So not only can he get you buckets, he's good help on defense. I just think it should be strongly considered by JB to let him get a start or two just to see if it's maybe a \"flash in the pan\" or is he making the team stronger/more dangerous as a starter.
