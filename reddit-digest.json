Nothing. He walked past them, as our people say – as if past a Turkish cemetery. With a single wave of the hand, without looking, like when he assists his teammates, which the greatest optimists interpreted as a greeting…  \n  \n>And they were waiting, all dressed up, neatly prepared, in traditional costumes that they had carefully prepared, washed, and repaired days in advance especially for this occasion.  \n  \n>And in the end they returned home sad, deprived of a memory they would have cherished for the rest of their lives – to meet a brilliant basketball player, their countryman, whom they admire and for whom they cheer with all their hearts.  \n  \n>Luckily, they were already old enough, so they did not really cry or shed tears, which did happen last year, in the same place, on the same occasion…  \n  \n>Namely, back then, also after a Denver–Chicago game, more than 300 of our children, little ones, waited for over an hour in the arena corridor to meet the MVP, the best in the world. In vain.  \n  \n>Nikola Jokić did not deem it worthy to dedicate five minutes of his time to them.  \n  \n>In the end, another great basketball player, but also a great man, Nikola Vučević, appeared and comforted them, even though he does not play for the Serbian but for the Montenegrin national team.  \n  \n>He came out of the locker room and kindly posed with the children, tossed them some “bones,” talked with them and their parents…\n\nFull article: [https://serbiantimes.info/en/column-kovacevic-nikola-jokic-childrens-tears-and-the-difference-between-a-great-basketball-player-and-a-great-man-video/](https://serbiantimes.info/en/column-kovacevic-nikola-jokic-childrens-tears-and-the-difference-between-a-great-basketball-player-and-a-great-man-video/)",
