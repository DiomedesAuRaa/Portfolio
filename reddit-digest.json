        "selftext": "If you just look at Diego Pavia without the personality and antics:\n\n* Zero D1 offers, only two D2 offers out of high school\n* Played at a community college and transferred to New Mexico State, which is a historically bad program that is 5th worst all-time in win percentage\n* Led them to their first double-digit win season since 1960\n* Transferred to Vanderbilt, another historically bad program that is bottom 30 all-time in win percentage, 7th worst all-time for Power 5, and worst all-time in the SEC\n* Leads them to their first winning season in a decade, then their first double-digit win season in history. \n* Plays some genuinely good and exciting football with a fun to watch playstyle. Heisman runner-up\n* Is 5'9, scrappy, and would be the shortest QB to ever play in the NFL\n\nHe would have been the biggest slam-dunk, easy-to-root-for underdog ever if he wasn't such an ass. You literally could not write a better underdog story if you tried. And nobody hated Vanderbilt as a program either, they would've been as universally well-liked as Indiana if Pavia had even been half the man that Fernando is. Absolutely generational fumble tbh. ",

Their only loss came after a freak missed field goal against 11 win TCU who themselves were 2 scores away from a perfect season). Every one of their 12 wins (including dominating Georgia was by double digits. They averaged 44 points a game and only gave up 19 a game, despite having just joined the deeper MWC from the WAC). \n\n2017 UCF\n\nI feel like 2017 UCF was the last truly great G5 (at the time) team. \n\n2021 Cincinnati and 2024 Boise State did make the playoffs but each had flaws and holes that were evident throughout the season. And we know and weren't surprised what happened to JMU and Tulane this season. \n\n",

I’m still learning the game of Baseball, and I love it, maybe even more than Basketball, never been more enamored with a sport in a while, and that’s why I wanna root for a historically piss-poor team.\n\nWhy? ‘Coz I kinda like that struggle and slowly learn, and hopefully see a team gradually win and improve, as weird as it seems, and I don’t live in the US (or Canada) and cant really cheer for a state/city/. So, whichever metric or category you choose, whether its statistically or your own opinion, who’s like the most consistently disappointing, trash fire at worst, mediocre at best franchise in the history of the MLB?\n\nEdit: Decision made. \n\nFirst of all, thanks for the answers, everyone here is super friendly, joining this sub here for sure.\n\nLos Angeles Angels it is. I was a Lakers fan through the Kobe-Gasol era, and the Josh McRoberts era of the team. The Lakers are my team but I somehow really hate them, I think thats just part of rooting for an LA team, in this case, im rooting for the MLB equivalent of the Clippers.\n\nI saw that the Angels spend big hoping to get somewhere just by doing that and getting mad it doesnt work, reminds me of the mid-2010s NBA LA teams.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, the Rockies were a good choice for exactly what i said in the post, but I may have underestimated the kind of pain I was willing to endure when I saw all your comments about them, I’mma need a very tiny bit of hope, even just a spec.\n\nAngels it is.\n\nEdit 2: Sorry, guys, Angels win. The Mariners look promising and the Rockies scare me. Also, I’ve changed my flair and my favorite team on The Show to the Angels, so there’s no going back. 🫡",

He\\\\ makes his mistakes but overall he play very clean, and hasn't had long dips.\n\nOffense Line needs to solidify. It may have peaked two years ago, but no reason the offense can't be successful if they can be more solid than last year. Get the run going again and Goff's world opens up.\n\nDefense needs to be healthy all around for once in a year. I think again while our D was never our strongest. If healthy, they should be very good/great. They are more than enough to contend for the big win.\n\nThen, we just need to play in sync ball. All three phases need to firing at the same time, like a well oiled machine. \n\nKEY INJURIES killed us last year on BOTH sides of the ball at the SAME time. \n\nI feel like we played well considering. . . and now maybe people will sleep on the same ol lions again, just a little bit. \n\nAll more fuel for our fire.",
