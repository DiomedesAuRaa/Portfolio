When NBC announced him as a “special contributor,” I genuinely expected more than what we’ve gotten - maybe live appearances, real analysis, or at least fresh insight on today’s NBA.\nInstead, it feels like NBC keeps recycling the same pre-taped interview clips, and that’s about it. For someone of Jordan’s stature, the buildup versus the actual output feels way off.\nI’m curious how others see it:\nDo you think this is NBC overselling the role? Or were expectations for MJ just unrealistic to begin with? And more broadly, do legends like Jordan even need to be doing TV roles like this, or does it rarely live up to the hype?",
