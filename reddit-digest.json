He signed a two-year contract that will pay him $5.5 million this season and has a $5.7 million player option for next season.\n\n> Yabusele hasn’t found his footing with the Knicks after an OK season with a bad Philadelphia 76ers team last season. The 30-year-old has struggled defensively while also shooting below 31 percent from 3 and less than 40 percent from the field overall and averaging under 10 minutes per game for head coach Mike Brown.\n\n> Given New York’s financial situation, it can’t afford to get nothing out of that salary slot.\n\n> Multiple league executives believe the Knicks would have to attach something to Yabusele in order to have a chance to move him before the deadline. Other than what New York does or doesn’t do with Yabusele, the franchise has long put out feelers about adding another ballhandler and/or frontcourt player, per league sources.",

        "selftext": "Looking for a reality check.\n\nI’ve done OE before, where I had both J1 and J2 at the same time. In those roles, things were genuinely chill. I could finish work early or sometimes close to sprint end, but the key thing was that I could always get everything done before the sprint ended without stress. There was flexibility in how and when work got completed.\n\nMy current role is a **Data Engineer** position, fully remote, but the setup feels very different. Just J1 atm, old J1 and J2 has been let go for reasons\n\nEach engineer is expected to take on **16–18 story points per sprint**, and story points are roughly defined like this:\n\n* 1 SP = less than 1 hour\n* 2 SP = half day\n* 3 SP = one full day\n* 5 SP = 2–5 days\n* 8 SP = could take as long as it takes\n\nSo in practice, this feels like being booked close to full capacity every sprint.\n\nSome example tickets, with what they realistically involve:\n\n* **Complete new dataset addition to an existing pipeline – 3 SP(1day)** Usually ends up being around **2 days**, including data profiling, schema checks, transformations, pipeline changes, testing, fixing edge cases, code reviews, and deployment.\n* **Create solution documentation for the whole project – 2 SP** Supposed to be half a day, but often turns into **2 days** once reviews, revisions, diagrams, and feedback cycles are included.\n* **Create reports – 2 SP** Typically more than half a day when you factor in requirement clarification, data validation, query tuning, stakeholder feedback, and rework.\n\nironically, my previous J1 would easily give me 3 days(5sp) for all three of this kind of tasks. maybe just 2 days(5sp) for reports in tight sprints.  \n  \nA lot of the effort is in things that aren’t explicitly in the ticket: reviews, testing, back-and-forth, and waiting on feedback.\n\nDeadlines are strict, but there’s little attention paid to how tickets are scoped or broken down. If something slips, it’s very visible, even when the ticket itself was loosely defined.\n\nCompared to my previous OE experience, this role feels tightly packed and less forgiving. Even though it’s remote, I’m finding it hard to see where OE would realistically fit without risking burnout or performance issues.\n\nFor those who’ve done OE as data engineers, does this sound like a role that’s just not OE-friendly by nature, or is this more a case of bad sprint planning and management? Curious how others would evaluate this setup.\n\nThanks for any honest input.",

I've done it before but didn't last more than 2 months because the amount of meetings and mental overloads started crushing me. Unfortunately, this is the type of job that is full of meetings everyday and due to that not the best for OE. In hindsight, I probably didn't perform the right due diligence to actually qualify the second job as OE-able. My current plan is to keep my existing W-2 and find a contract role. I value my existing job and it pays well so I want to keep it as a high priority and do the bare minimum in my contract role. \n\nBelow are my criteria for the new role (let me know if there is anything missing that I should be on the lookout for):\n- Mid to Large organization - 500+ employees\n- Async-first culture so I can dodge most meeting\n- Old tech/ legacy software support instead of new initiatives - this should help reduce cognitive load associated with new projects\n- I am NOT expected to drive projects, only assist in completion (tough as a PM since most jobs expect you to drive)\n- I am NOT the only PM on the team - this will allow to smear responsibility across multiple team members. \n\nI'm looking for advice from people that successfully OE as managers is software (product managers, project managers, engineering managers, etc) basically anyone who has to deal with lots of meetings and having to \"drive\" projects instead of complete tasks that were handed off to you. How do you handle this and not go crazy? Is there anything missing in my plan?",

No, that does not mean we should be content with mediocrity.\n\nIt’s OK to be disappointed by this season.

It’s very natural to be disappointed in missing the playoffs the very next year. We as a long suffering fan base deserve better, and it’s perfectly okay to express that.\n\nJust because we once went 0-16, that doesn’t mean we should be forever content.",

            "body": "So I actually feel like I have something to add here. I’ve sat a couple rows behind this guy (the blue hair fan) on multiple occasions. He’s definitely a season ticket holder in the first row, because I have a season ticket package split with a buddy and he’s been at every single home game I’ve gone to. \n\nHe’s extremely obnoxious to the point where other fans are over it but I’ve never heard him say anything that would be considered too far or out of line. Just basic taunting mostly about football, for example calling out players for dropped balls, etc. He’s just loud and annoying and doesn’t stop. He also definitely calls players by their full names.\n\nWith all that said I find it crazy how many people on reddit are just jumping to assume he said the n word or similar. Firstly, there is a security guard who sits right next to the row he’s in and the fan would have absolutely been tossed for that. Second, the season ticket holders have the fan code of conduct drilled into their heads. You can absolutely lose your tickets for something like this, and they let him return to his seats? That doesn’t add up with him saying anything too crazy. They took a guys season tickets away a couple years ago for jawing at lafleur during the flag ceremony. Finally, DK is known for being one of if not the biggest loose cannons in the entire league, you think this it’s really outside the realm of possibility for him to just have thin skin and throw a punch at a fan for something minor?? \n\nI actually made a comment in the game thread when it happened that I recognized the guy and how annoying he was , but didn’t really feel the need to post here until seeing all the reddit warriors saying how the fan definitely said something heinous and deserved to be punched.\n\nSide note, the league called back a TD for the Lions earlier this year because it was a trick play and they said Goff was not set. No flag was thrown. So you’re telling me they are able to call that in from NY with no flag, but not call in to remove a player who hit a fan in the face? What an absolute farce.\n\nLink to comment in game thread 20 hrs ago https://www.reddit.com/r/detroitlions/s/R00d21oM2J",

        "selftext": "Last season it felt like no matter what the record was, it wasn't good enough, and the team had a fire up its ass every single week. There was a chip on the shoulder, and the team needed to prove itself on every single play, which is the mantra that carried it from 3-13-1 to 15-2.\n\nThis season it feels like that intensity, that desperation to prove that they belong among the elite, was lost. Dan was talking about the playoffs early in the season as if it was a given that they'd make it. Every loss was a \"good thing\", and there was a casual \"we'll have that fixed when December rolls around\" kind of attitude. There was no urgency, no sense that every loss was crucially important, no major schematic changes when it was clear that some things weren't working, just arrogance that if they keep going they way they are things will work out.\n\nThe Lions got soft. That hard nosed, kneecap biting team that no one wanted to play became a soft team that frequently lost the battle of wills when the big moments came.\n\nI don't want Dan or Brad to go anywhere, but they need to wake up to how badly things have been allowed to slip culturally and mentally this season. Nothing can be taken for granted, everything must be proved and earned in the moment. I want that chip back on the shoulder, I want to see the Lions out-tough opponents again, I want to see them respond to setbacks with urgency and intensity.\n\nI don't care about the injuries. The talent on the field yesterday was good enough to win that game, and others that were lost. Other teams have coached successfully around having weak O-lines or lots of injuries to one particular unit on the defense, neither of those are unique problems that only the Lions faced this season, but the arrogant attitude is what prevented them from really addressing and adjusting to those weaknesses.\n\nBring back grit.",
