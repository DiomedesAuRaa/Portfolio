        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1pwra6v/highlight_an_incredible_punt_jack_foxs_67airyard/",
        "selftext": "A fact of football is that the punt is objectively the best offensive football play. There is no other play that averages 45+ yards; there isn't one even close. Its safe to say that this was the Lions best offensive play of the game on Saturday, for many reasons.\n\n  \nFirst off, the numbers: 67 air yards (70 with the roll), 4.8s of hang, and about 8-9 yards from the sideline and at the 4 yard line is where this drops.\n\n\n\n2nd off: I talk a lot about drop punts (nose down, Aussie style) and why their bounces are not controllable. That is not this punt. This is a traditional, spiraling kick and these bounces *are somewhat controllable*. There are a few different ways to hit these balls but most are similar. They all share (except the inverted) in that the nose of the ball has a slight tilt downwards (approx 10^(o)) and pointed at 11 o'clock (about 30^(o) counterclockwise for righties, opposite for southpaws). The two most common position for the laces is to be pointing towards the sky or rotated 90^(o) towards the direction of the dominant kicking foot. There are different reasons for doing these, largely in where the ball will drift. The sweet spot is still the same, near the lower center portion of the ball on the seam where it molds itself to your foot before springing off and spiraling (when done right). This is a 90^(o) turn on Fox's drop. I know this as a half-turn traditional ball (or half-turn spiral) but it may have other names too. \n\n  \nWhen a ball travels over 57-60 yards, its a near guarantee that its a spiral. Drop punts, bananas, watermelons, louis', etc are not nearly as aerodynamic and would require far more force to travel the same distance. Its possible (Mitch Wishnowsky can hit the deep drop punts occasionally) but its rare. Additionally, not every attempt at a spiral actually spirals. Wobble along the long axis of the ball often leads to balls not \"turning over\" (not arching in air, where the nose drops as the ball comes down). These will often not travel as far for, again, a lack of being aerodynamic. This is a big struggle with punting into wind and why punters who rely on sky-balls often struggle in the elements (ahem, my beloved JK Scott). For more on the why behind these phenomena, consult your local university's physics department. Generally speaking though, long balls are a well-hit spiral. \n\n  \nConsidering just punts that do spiral, picture the orientation of the ball as it makes contact with the ground. The angle is going to be based off the eccentricity of the parabolic curve that the ball's flight path takes, but the nose will be facing towards the ground. While not guaranteed (no playing surface is a perfectly level plane), the ball is far more likely to recoil rather than bounce in the direction it would have otherwise continued on without the ground. For balls that come down with an axis not perpendicular to the yard lines, a lateral bounce becomes more likely (recoil into the sideline). My degrees are in mathematics and education, so I welcome any physics instructors and engineers to chime in. I only do math that doesn't have real-world applications.\n\n\n\nWith that covered, on we go and there's probably two people or so wondering: Isn't this an out-kick of the coverage unit? To that, yeah, it is. I can't say that I have ever seen a 65+ yard punt that wasn't. While we cannot see the returner in the beginning of the video, when they come into frame they are at the 20. I would wager this returner was at the 25 to start. I have no issues with a punter who overshoots a returner by 20 yards. No returner is going to backtrack 20 yards and catch a punt on the run inside the 5. Their momentum would take them into the end-zone (punt returners are protected by momentum but its still super risky). Its very safe to say that this ball is not getting returned. \n\n  \nWhich leads us to the placement of this punt, just outside the numbers, about 8-9 yards from the sideline. This is better than dropping one inside the hashes, just generally speaking, but especially here. 67 yards on 4.8s of hang isn't going to be enough time for a gunner to down it. This ball is either going out of bounds, backwards/bouncing around in the field of play, or into the end-zone. Any bounce after the second is completely random and thus relying on those additional bounces is a poor strategy. If this ball is placed between the hashes, the chances it goes out of bounds prior to a second bounce is highly unlikely and randomness is introduced. Instead, it skips straight out of bounds. To be fair, that it went out at the 1 is somewhat lucky. Even by hitting this ball well, to get the angle that perfect is a little random, but Fox did everything right here to increase his odds. Whether this goes out just inside the end-zone or at the 5, its still a great punt, IMO.\n\n  \nAll in all, a fantastic punt, worthy of love as a fan (punt go boom) and by analyzing. Plus, the kids love a good six-seven. Its a +2 for me, an elite punt. My only gripe is that none of you posted it during the game (including me). We all failed the sub and the punting gods.\n\n  \nIf you read this far, thank you, I appreciate it. Also, consider this a free tism diagnosis.",

Dan has always been a CEO type, leaning into where the team is struggling but always returning to that CEO role after.\n\n\nThis off-season he hired a very inexperienced coordinator in Shep, I assume the plan was to lean into helping Shep throughout the season.\n\n\nThis worked fairly well until Morton started to struggle, then Dan starting playing whack-a-mole.  Get the offense fixed, defense would fall apart.  Get the defense fixed the offense would fall apart.\n\n\nUltimately his coaches failed him and he failed his players.\n\n\nSo next year how do you fix this?  Well Dan needs to first decide if he's a play caller or CEO.  If he's a CEO he needs to hire a play caller, someone creative that can own the offense.\n\n\nNext he needs to get Shep some help, a senior defensive assistant that can help so Dan doesn't have to.  Ideally a former HC with 20+ years of coaching, a guy partially retired that can be a sounding board.\n\n\nGet those 2 things figured out and this team will bounce back.",

That's not going to change, we know it and defenses know it. \n\n-Organization miscues, mainly hiring Morton as OC then needing to pull him, not addressing roster needs at the deadline, the weird Ragnow debacle \n\n-Opposing teams now consider the Lions one of the best, so they prepare and play their best. They're no longer the dark horse and teams have been exploiting their weaknesses all season. \n\nPut all of that in a blender and we get the 2025 season. I think this is where we really see what the Sheila/Holmes/Campbell era can do. The Lions have had great success for two and half seasons, now it's clearly time to make adjustments and we'll see how they respond. \n\nI'm excited to see where they go from here.

I really think they wanted the interior lines to be\n\n2025\n\nMahogs/Glasgow - Rags - Rat\n\n2026\n\nMahogs - Rat - Frazier\n\n2. Someone made a post about it a day ago, but they transitioned to a passing offense relying on deeper routes/ more 7 step drops than last year. It seems odd to do this when you are also breaking in a new center.\n\n3. The Ragnow “un-retirement ” and how it went down. I think the team was expecting him to just come back in 2025, and Rags felt bad going back on his word so he tried to flip the switch when he saw them struggling. He likely gets hurt ramping up which is how the hamstring issue happened.\n\nMy guess is at some point after the 2024 season  Ragnow had changed his mind but the wheels were already in motion - draft and FA had happened so team had to deal with what they had.\n\nI also think Ragnow has been 50/50 on coming back in 2026, but if my theory is true the team will prepare as if they don’t expect him back, meaning either Rat at C or a notable free agent pickup (it’s incredibly rare for a rookie to start at Center so I don’t see that either).",
