But multiple people familiar with the process said any buyout would involve Darvish giving up the bulk of what he would be owed and that the Padres are set to realize a significant savings over the next three years. That money is intended to be used to help make the team better.\n\n>“As far as leaving lots of money,” Darvish said in a recent interview, “I look at it as that was never mine to begin with, especially considering the money I haven’t physically earned yet.”\n\nAll-timer class move from a player. Could have a significant impact on the Padres, considering reports that they've been strapped for cash.\n\nEdit: Given that this comment is at the top I feel I should add the statement Yu's agent has put out: \n\n>“Yu has not made a final decision yet.
