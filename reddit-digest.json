        "selftext": "This season has inarguably ended in a disappointing fashion, with Detroit eliminated from the playoffs, finishing with at least six fewer wins than last year, and seeming to tail off at the end of the year.\n\nEmotionally, it feels as if the organization is on a downward path and the team's window is closing. Departed components of the team last year (Johnson, Ragnow, etc.) were sorely missed. The 2024 and 2025 draft classes have not (yet) performed to the level of Holmes' previous three. We're all at least a little worried about the future, feeling like this team isn't in the upper echelons of the league anymore.\n\nBut that narrative is based, of course, on our monkey-brain perceptions of the data available. And that data tends to most heavily weigh final records. But the objective data indicates that this team was much better than its current 8-8 record, and had just **five different plays** gone differently, they might be in the pole position for the number one overall seed in the NFC.\n\n**1. 11/16 -** [Philadelphia Eagles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd2ZeLUBgTI)\n\nIt's week 11, and Detroit is engaged in a dogfight against Philadelphia. Philly's defensive line is brutalizing Detroit's offensive line, but Detroit's defense is giving nearly as good against Philly.\n\nWith about 5 minutes left in the third quarter, the Lions have moved the ball down to the Philadelphia 3 yard line. It's fourth down, and Campbell dials up a mesh concept pass. Jaelan Philips leaves Sewell in the dust around the edge and Jordan Davis rips past Awosika up the middle. Goff rushes the throw and misses St. Brown in the back of the end zone.\n\nHowever, had those guys held their blocks for a split second longer, Brock Wright was coming across the middle, and he had an absolutely clear path to the end zone. Goff didn't get a chance to see him because of the pressure, but had he seen Wright, Wright could have walked into the end zone.\n\nNow, Philly got the ball back at the end of the game with plenty of time to move down the field for a field goal, but it could easily have gone into overtime, given how both teams were playing. And who knows what happens then?\n\n**2. 11/27** \\- [Green Bay Packers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC66cMtILT0&t=445s)\n\nWeek 13. Thanksgiving Detroit is playing their second game against Green Bay. With about 11 minutes left in the fourth quarter, Goff takes the shotgun snap, drops back, and both lines collide in a massive pile. Goff rolls out to his right and sees Jameson Williams open, three steps ahead of the nearest defender. He throws the pass behind Jamo, who can't bring it in.\n\nHad Goff thrown that pass on-target, Keisean Nixon is the only Green Bay defender downfield in front of the fastest player in the league, and he's guarding Isaac Teslaa, who was drafted because of his willingness to block. If Williams catches that in stride, it's almost surely a touchdown. Those seven points end up being the difference between a loss and OT (though, to be fair, Green Bay did end the game in field goal range).\n\n**3. 12/14** \\- [Los Angeles Rams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjfUmHSo0ig&t=747s)\n\nWeek 15. It's the third quarter, the Lions are down by 3 against the Rams. Jameson Williams runs a deep post. Goff makes the right read, launches a great pass down the field to Jamo, who has the Rams defender by a step. The defender commits a clear pass interference as Jamo races by, and both trip, with Jamo diving for the ball and failing to reel it in.\n\nIf Jamo isn't interfered with, he houses that throw. Again, that seven represents the difference between losing in regulation and going to overtime.\n\n**4. 12/21** \\- [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_z6d12c8oU)\n\nThe end of this game probably doesn't even need an explanation - three different plays could have gone differently - if Teslaa doesn't get called for a questionable PI, if he catches a (difficult) pass in the end zone, or if St. Brown doesn't get called for a push-off, the Lions win.\n\n**5. 11/2** \\- Minnesota Vikings\n\nI have a video for the other four, but this one is pretty straightforward - Jake Bates' 45-yard field goal attempt in the fourth quarter was blocked. Those three points are the difference between a loss an OT.\n\nOf course, Detroit would have to win those games in OT, and that's hardly a given. But even if they only won two of those (and beat Pittsburgh), they'd be 11-5 right now and playing Chicago next week for the division crown, and the narrative on this team would be *very* different from the doomerism running rampant through the sub right now.\n\nUltimately this was a frustrating season to watch, but even with the struggles on the O-line, devastating injuries, and the much-discussed offensive scheming, they were *that close*. This year may have felt like a step backwards, but this is the NFL, where parity and attrition are king and queen. Everyone has weaknesses. This team is still in its window, but next year, a team that ended 2-5 in one-score games just needs to come out on top of those moments a little more often.",

The pick OPI that the defender got burnt and clearly made contact with Teslaa. Also DK punching fan yet played the entire game.\n\n\nBonus game: the fist Vikings game. Refs call a roughing the passer on Campbell for making a football tackle on McCarthy giving the Vikings a 1st instead of 4th down Which wouldn’t be as bad if you didn’t consider Goff getting kicked in the head to no flag. And Goff getting sacked the same way numerous of times following call.

The last game was among the most egregious, in my opinion.\n\nI know it sounds like I’m nitpicking an otherwise stellar tenure as our head coach, and maybe that’s true (I am gay). But for me, this season, in particular the next month or so, is an absolutely vital time to evaluate our young core. The data we get from this will determine our future for the next several years. Thus, when I see players like Ron, Ausar, and Ivey not getting significant playing time (especially in the 4th quarter) in lieu of Dannis Jenkins and Caris LeVert, I want to fucking scream.",

Kawhi reminded us old guys he's a HOFer and showed the young guys.\n\nWhat gets me is when he was just lighting up Tobias for the whole first half where was the adjustment?\n\nDid the Pistons double team him to get the ball out of his hands? No.  \nDid they sub Tobias out for younger more athletic guys like Ron or Ausar? No.  \n  \nNope they let him just blow up.   \n  \nBut surely in the second half there would be a change of some kind right? No. Tobias was on him.  \n  \nWhen did they double team him? In the 4th quarter when they were down 14!  \n  \nCuz I guess it was okay to lose the game but they didn't want him to get the all time single game scoring record?   \n\nI'm not saying the double team would have changed much. But here's what I do know.\n\nWhen any great player comes out hot you've got to try and stop him right away! Because when he sees that ball go in 3-4 times! He's feeling confident!\n\nNope Pistons let him get 40 before they doubled.  \n\nTo me that's crazy! Like I said probably a loss anyway. But when you look at that lineup, who besides a Hot Kawhi are you afraid of? Double Kawhi, keep someone on the Beard and let 97 year old Brooke Lopez try to beat you! \n\nThey doubled Cade, slowed him down. \n\nMy 2 cents. Am I crazy? ",
