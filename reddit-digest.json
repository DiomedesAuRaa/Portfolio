        "selftext": "Historically when you ask this on this sub, the answer for the former is heavily debated and the answer for the latter is just \"you don't become a blue blood, you have to always be a top program across CFB history.\" However, that isn't really true, is it?\n\nIf you look at Nebraska before Devaney, what you see is a \"pretty good\" program. Nebraska wasn't considered a blue blood until they had one of the most impressive extended runs of any program ever between 1963 and 2001. In this 38-year span they had all 5 of their claimed national titles, an additional 6 unclaimed national championships, finished in the top-10 in 27 of those 38 seasons, and generally remained one of *the* premier programs. This run is what made Nebraska a blue blood, so nobody can really argue that a program can't *become* a blue blood. Any program with sufficiently strong history and a dominant enough run can eventually rack up numbers comparable to the existing blue bloods.\n\nWhat qualifies someone as a blue blood? Strong enough history that they can be considered strong across much of CFB's past, plenty of national titles, talent put into the NFL, and if you ask on this sub... [the chart](http://cfbcomparer.com/ap-poll-leaders). You can see that while Nebraska still has a decent gap over the next-best programs, there is still a very real possibility of who might pass them. Let's say that any program who passes Nebraska on all of these metrics has certifiably \"become\" a blue blood. \n\n\n**Georgia** is first up, as they're closer to surpassing Nebraska currently. \n\n* Georgia needs **one** more claimed national title to match Nebraska's 5, and two to surpass them. That seems very attainable given how strong the program is under Smart.\n\n* Georgia **already** surpasses Nebraska in both draft picks (22 more) and first-round draft picks (18 more)\n\n* Georgia needs **38** more ranked weeks to tie Nebraska. Given that Nebraska has finished unranked every season since 2012, this is easily attainable in 3, maybe 4 seasons depending on how Nebraska performs.\n\n* Georgia needs **83** more weeks ranked in the top 5 to tie Nebraska. Given that Georgia is fairly consistently in the top 5 under Kirby, and Nebraska does not seem to be returning to the top 5 anytime soon, this isn't actually that bad. This could theoretically be attained in the next 5 seasons, but to be conservative let's say 7. \n\nRealistically, if Kirby continues his current success and wins another title or two, Georgia should have every claim at having surpassed Nebraska in all the most relevant metrics by the time that 2033 rolls around. At that point, how does anyone say that Nebraska is a blue blood but Georgia is not? I'm not sure, honestly.\n\nSo what about **LSU**?\n\n* LSU **already** ties Nebraska in national titles, and could surpass them by winning one more. Given their hot streak this century and how well Lane Kiffin has done lately, I think the odds are pretty solid for them here.\n\n* LSU **already** surpasses Nebraska in draft picks (18 more) and first-round draft picks (19 more)\n\n* LSU needs **47** more ranked weeks to tie Nebraska. That could take as few as three seasons, but I assume Nebraska will spend more than a few weeks ranked so presumably this will take at least 4.\n\n* One big hurdle LSU has, however, is that they have fewer than *half* the weeks ranked in the top 5. That could be argued to be an arbitrary metric by some, but I think it does speak a lot when a program is able to sustain that high level of success for a lot of time. LSU would have to be ranked in the top 5 for an additional **156** weeks to tie Nebraska, the equivalent of over 9 full seasons in the top 5. Under a dynasty this is technically attainable in the next ~15 years, but realistically I don't think LSU can surpass Nebraska here until ~20-30 years out.\n\nLSU can pass Nebraska in most metrics in the next few years, but in order to surpass them in all metrics they'll be held back by their lack of top-5 ranked weeks for a long time. Still, within 20-30 years they will quite possibly surpass Nebraska on all fronts.\n\nAnd... **Penn State**? Are you serious OP?\n\n* Actually yeah. Penn State currently ties Georgia in titles, meaning they're only **1** title away from tying Nebraska. Given how close they've been to breaking through recently, the right coach could certainly take them there.\n\n* And yet again, Penn State **already** surpasses Nebraska with draft picks (24 more) and first-round draft picks (10 more)\n\n* Penn State needs only **16** weeks ranked to surpass Nebraska in that metric. That will be the first time since the creation of this website that any program has passed a blue blood in \"the chart,\" and realistically it probably happens in the 2027-2028 season. \n\n* Penn State is also a lot closer than LSU in terms of weeks in the top 5 - needing **109** weeks in the top 5 to surpass Nebraska. That is still the equivalent of over 6 full seasons, but given that Penn State has regularly hit the top 5 recently during the season I think they could accomplish this before LSU does. \n\nI think some people will be surprised at how much Penn State is on the cusp of pulling this off, given that most probably rate the job as a tier below Georgia/LSU right now. They may lack a very-recent title, but Penn State still has a long history of success that has them right in this discussion.\n\n---\n\nAll this... *except*...\n\nThere is one metric that Nebraska still far and away dog-walks these programs in. Conference Championships\n\nNebraska: 46\n\nGeorgia: 17\n\nLSU: 16\n\nPenn State: 4\n\nThe question is really how much you value this as a metric. Can you really be a blue blood if you don't dominate your opposition? But then again - Penn State spent most of its history as independent. If ND can be a blue blood without conference championships, surely another program could. It's also debatable whether being in a stronger conference should hold you back, as if LSU/Georgia have a similar historical level of success in everything *except* conference championships they certainly have a strong argument.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Are we on the cusp of seeing the first changes in the blue blood list in most of our lifetimes? Or is Nebraska simply at risk of falling off without any other programs joining quite yet?",

        "selftext": "1894 Yale was the only other college football team besides Indiana to go 16-0, so obviously the were the best team during that entire time period. So let’s say after next season, (Once the 2026 regular season is over) a scientist found a way to bring people back to life and brought the entire 1894 Yale team back. The scientist was able to make them exactly how they were during that 1894 season, (same athleticism and age) and the University of Yale football program decided to get rid of all their current players and add that 1894 team to their new roster.\n\nNow, during the 2026-2027 offseason, that entire Yale team had all that time to be taught the way football works in the modern world, train and weight lift, learn Yale’s current playbook, anything they need to learn to be able to compete for the 2027 season.\n\nThe NCAA then decided to add them into the FBS, as well as ban them from getting any transfers or add any new high school recruits to their roster. They then get added as an independent. The NCAA also allows them to have unlimited practice, and let’s say this is all in a scenario that this 1894 Yale team is fully committed and motivated to playing football again, as well as it is impossible for the players to get injured and the refs have a bias towards them in every game. They also have the easiest schedule out of any FBS team in 2027.\n\nNow this begs the question, how would they perform in the 2027 season? Would they just get belt to ass every single game? Maybe sneak in a win or two?",

In 1946, the Chicago Cardinals traveled to Los Angeles to play the Rams. But airplanes were pretty expensive and ownership didn’t want to pay for that, so they took the train from Chicago to LA. \n\nThe two routes to go from Chicago to LA in the 1940s were to go straight west to Omaha, then from there to Salt Lake City and down through Las Vegas to LA, or to go southwest to Kansas City, then through New Mexico and Arizona on the way to LA. And a Chicago Tribune [article](https://img.newspapers.com/img/img?user=17312055&id=369962467&clippingId=184577717&width=750&height=1750&crop=5278_332_750_1750&rotation=0&iat=eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjM2OTk2MjQ2NywiaWF0IjoxNzcxMDc5MTUxLCJleHAiOjE3NzExNjU1NTF9.Wl7v4KSm0gkZ8SL6YjbEZTApHsF7wLvY7soxKU1ChTOofNAemgNhOQLNpH9J_dPdRt_wdLlB2EYCQfWu3ZlOwg) from November 12, 1946 says the Cards took the Chicago & North Western railway for their game with the Rams. The C&NW went to Omaha but not to Kansas City in 1940, which means the Cardinals took the northern route and avoided Arizona in 1946.\n\nThe next year, the Cardinals and Rams played in LA in October. They again took the train, and on the Thursday before the game the Tribune had a [piece](https://img.newspapers.com/img/img?user=17312055&id=369888188&clippingId=191269849&width=782&height=2692&crop=3115_279_782_2692&rotation=0) about the Cards prepping for the Rams while on the train in Salt Lake City. So they avoided Arizona this time too.\n\nBut when they arrived in LA, Jeff Burkett, the Cardinals’ star punter (he had by far the [most](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1947/punting.htm) yards/punt in ‘47) had appendicitis and needed immediate surgery. He missed the Rams game to recover, and while the rest of the team took the train back, the Cards ownership got Burkett on a plane back to Chicago a few days later. This was a direct flight from LA to Chicago, which does indeed go through Arizona.\n\nWhich means that the first Cardinals player to enter the state of Arizona as an active player was Jeff Burkett flying on [United Flight 608](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Air_Lines_Flight_608) on October 24th, 1947. While flying over Arizona, the plane caught on fire, a wing fell off, and it exploded when it hit the ground. Witnesses described the explosion as akin to the photos they’d seen of Hiroshima two years prior. Everybody on board died.\n\nThe postscript to this is that a few weeks later a different flight of the same aircraft (a DC-6) was flying from California to Chicago, and while over Arizona this one also caught on fire. But this time the pilot managed to land the plane safely, where FAA investigators studied the DC-6 and found a design flaw. The investigation into the crash of United 608 was closed.\n\nIt’s obvious to me what happened here, and hopefully it’s obvious to you too. The state of Arizona took Jeff Burkett as a blood sacrifice, then covered up its murder of him by staging another “crash”. In exchange for Burkett's life, the Cardinals would win the championship in 1947, but would then be indebted to Arizona. \n\nThe Cardinals did win the championship in 1947 and never won again, and now Arizona has them trapped and they never will win again. I don't know how we can begin to solve this, but if we want to free the Cardinals from the grasp of Arizona, acknowledging the truth is a good place to start.",

And when you’ve kind of driven a certain way for the last 15 years, it’s pretty tough to undo some of those things, especially when some of them are lifting on straights or stuff like that. Obviously, as a driver, you never want to be lifting at any point. But yeah, I think, even without some of the challenges that we’ve got and the things we need to address as a sport, ultimately, they are cars that are slower, and then have less downforce and probably more power out of the corners, so they’re always going to feel difficult to drive and tricky. That aspect is kind of one thing, and then there’s all the aspects that are new and need some reform.\n\n>Starts need to be addressed, because, probably as we’ve all seen, it’s a pretty complicated process now to have a safe start, let alone a competitive one.\n\n>The thing is, everyone’s going to need different things for the start. And to be completely honest with you, I’m not sure any of us know exactly what we need yet.\n\n>I’m sure we’ll find a way to do a proper start. It’s just that the difference between a good and bad start last year was you got a bit of wheelspin or you had a bad reaction time, whereas this year, it could be, effectively, like an F2 race, where you almost go into anti-stall or something. You’re not just losing five meters or so. You can be losing six or seven spots, if it goes well.\n\n>And there’s plenty of topics to address. Starts, Overtaking is certainly going to be different as well. DRS was obviously just a pure advantage used to gain, whereas now, with the energy boost, you’ve obviously got to harvest that extra energy somehow and then deploy it, which with some of the rules in place, is not always that straightforward.\n\n>I think following is very similar to last year, in all honesty, which is not a big surprise to me, but there’s definitely a lot of things to talk about and address before Melbourne.\n\n>There’s so many things just from an even borderline safety point of view that need to be kind of figured out on track, that do need addressing.",

Huge lift of. 50% power from ICE, 50% power from hybrid. Discrepancy in top speed and acceleration between the different straights because of hybrid strategies.\n\nDrivers went crazy at acceleration with hybrid and cumulated power around 1000hp for 870kg. Then the electric engine shut off and they were driving cars with 500hp. Less power than LMP2. On Le Mans, driving through the pits saved enough energy to reach 30km/h more on the next straight than going through the start / finish line.\n\nBy then, no LMP1 driver complained. They had the most exciting cars ever at every corner exit. The fasters sport prototypes ever. The best on track battles since the Peugeot / Audi duel, or if we go back, since the 90's.",
