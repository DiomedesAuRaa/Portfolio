He says having a 100 OPS+ on the Pirates is not the same as having a 100 OPS+ on the Yankees or Dodgers. \n\nThe reasoning largely has to do with quality of opposition & how playing for a bad team (or with Pittsburgh in particular a bad lineup but good pitching) means you’re more likely to face better pitching later in games because you play in more close games to begin with. \n\nThey speak to an unnamed exec who basically validates Pham’s theory. They say most team models do incorporate this stuff & the impact isn’t huge or anything but it’s a legit take.\n\nHe also specifically calls out Jose Ramirez, says his numbers are being suppressed by playing for Cleveland, & that he wants to see weather-related variables integrated into defensive metrics.",

In the [Oso Trava](https://youtu.be/X7JshNb717k?si=qvCxg3qQMXxY66BJ) podcast, he elaborated on the exclusivity his former team granted to Max Verstappen and his feeling that he was never able to satisfy his employer, regardless of his performance level.\n\n*\"The team complained about everything ,\"* the Mexican driver asserted. *\"At Red Bull, everything was a problem. **If I was faster, it was a problem and it created a very tense environment. If I was slower than Max, that was also a problem.** I understood that these were the circumstances I was working in and, instead of complaining, I tried to make the best of it.\"*\n\n*\"I knew what I was getting into at Red Bull. **During my first discussion with Christian [Horner], he told me: 'We're going to race with two cars because we have to have two cars, but this project was created for Max, he's our talent.'** I was in the best team, a very complicated team. **Being Max's teammate is already very difficult, but being Max's teammate at Red Bull is the worst job in Formula 1.**\"*\n\nSacked at the end of the 2024 season, Sergio Pérez did not leave Red Bull on bad terms and never spoke ill of his former team, instead seeking to explain the situation he found himself in. When Christian Horner chose to replace him with Liam Lawson, who was himself demoted after two Grands Prix in favor of Yuki Tsunoda, Sergio Pérez sensed that the Milton Keynes team principal was not convinced.\n\n*\"At that moment, I said to him, 'Christian, what are you going to do when it doesn't work out with Liam?' He replied that there was Yuki. 'And what are you going to do when it doesn't work out with Yuki?' He replied, 'We have a lot of drivers.' I told him he was going to use them all and he said, 'Yes, I know.'\"*\n\nSince then, the situation at Red Bull has changed dramatically, with the successive departures of Christian Horner and Helmut Marko. Now led by Laurent Mekies, the team has chosen a new teammate for Max Verstappen for 2026. It remains to be seen whether the conditions will have changed and will allow Isack Hajjar to continue in a second seat that has become cursed in recent months.\"",

The fact of the matter is, the deep bench that allows us to plug and play whoever’s skill set is needed at any point in time is what gives us  an advantage over most other teams. (And those teams don’t have Cade)\n\nWhat happens when we got against a team with amazing interior defense like Cleveland? We sub in players like Dannis to bomb them from outside\n\nWhat happens when the other team is a bit older and slow? Ivey speeds past everyone and hits a ton of easy transition lays \n\nWhat about when the starting lineup is off all together ? Sasser gets his own bucket off the dribble \n\nObviously there are more situations where players like BBall Paul and Levert shine (although Levert has been off lately) but remeber Levert is 38% from three this season. \n\nWe are young. Our window is HUGE as long as Cade and Duren are here. Everyone on this team understands their roles and are ready to play any given night and don’t complain to the media when they are a healthy scratch. They understand that some nights aren’t going to be theirs. They play hard defensively no matter what the score is.This is the team others dream of. No reason to mess it up for an offensive player who takes away from the defensive identity of the team and makes others work even harder to compensate their lack of defensive focus. ",
