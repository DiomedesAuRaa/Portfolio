Juventus were the most advanced in their interest this month, but their proposal of a loan with a conditional obligation to buy, dependent on Champions League qualification, was deemed insufficient by Palace.\n\nAston Villa admire Mateta, but are limited by financial constraints. He was also discussed internally at Tottenham Hotspur before the transfer window opened, although the north London outfit does not plan to explore a move.\n\nPalace have set the objective of winning the Uefa Conference League in Oliver Glasner’s final season at the club, with Mateta a key part of the squad – scoring 10 goals in 33 appearances this term.",

        "selftext": "Jim Harding got right to work following Utah’s win over Nebraska on New Year’s Eve. The next day, he agreed to join Kyle Whittingham‘s staff in Ann Arbor, following him from Utah and marking his return to the midwest.\n\n... both Guarnera and Sprague generated a lot of interest from other national powers, but both left the door open for a potential return to Michigan and decided to give the new staff an opportunity to win them over.\n\n“The way that college football is set up, I don’t blame those two for going in at all,” Harding said on the ‘Stadium and Main’ podcast. “Actually Jake’s dad flew up and met with me, as well as Andrew’s parents flew over to sit down and meet. What I do appreciate is that they gave me an opportunity to kind of sell my vision, almost like a situation where I’m recruiting them like they were back in high school, where, hey, here’s what I’m all about.”\n\n... “The big message to them was, I’m saying a lot of things right now, but I had to — and I am still in the process of convincing them — that everything that I’m saying is going to be backed up with my actions and more,” the new Michigan coach said. “It’s not just, ‘Hey, let’s get you out of the portal and everything’s good.’ There’s a commitment on my end to make sure that I’m doing my part, because that room — not just those two — has a lot of really talented kids. \n\n“My impression of them right now is they want to be great, they want to be pushed — and it’s my job to make sure that I do that. \n\n“With those two kids specifically, it really was a situation of you’re almost treating it as they’re coming out of high school. Here are my goals for all the offensive linemen, here is what my track record has been, in terms of developing kids — Andrew being a tackle, Jake being an inside guy. Here’s what I’ve done.\n\n“In fact, they actually both, to their credit, asked for some of my players at Utah’s phone numbers, to go ahead and see if what I’m telling them in my meeting room at Michigan matches what I did at Utah. So, I had three or four of the guys, including Garrett Bolles actually got on the phone I know with Jake for sure to let him know what their experience was with me when I was their position coach at Utah.\n\n“They were really diligent about going through the decision of what they felt was best for them. I am biased, obviously, but I think they made the right decision, and I think they’re going to be really successful.”\n\n“Outside of the offensive line meeting room, there are the two pictures of the offensive lines that won it, emulating what the statue looks like,” Harding said. “So, it’s a huge expectation in this group. There are guys that were on the last Joe Moore team when they were younger, so they’ve seen what it looks like.”\n\n... “It’s going to take great technique, great fundamentals, a commitment to making sure that we’re being intentional with what we’re doing each day at practice. They can’t just show up on the 12 Saturdays of the season and expect to be recognized as one of the best. There’s certainly a culture and kind of a mindset that needs to be created that, if we’re going to get back to it — and Michigan has had an incredible tradition of offensive line play through the years, even before the Joe Moore Award. [Former Michigan All-American and national champion] Jon Jansen is right down the hallway doing media stuff, and so there’s a lot of great offensive line play.\n\n“We just have to understand that if we’re going to be recognized as one of the best in this program, we’ve got to be intentional with everything we’re doing, and that starts right now. It’s not a 12-day-a-year-thing, it’s every single day you’ve got to have the right mindset and approach. That’s what we’ve got to do.”",

Making the defense respect and fear the run game only makes him that much more dangerous off of play-action.\n\nAlso, go watch the stuff Petzing did with Trey McBride off of play action and tell me you can't see LaPorta absolutely slaughtering defenses on similar looks.

Our fans have every right to be skeptical of Drew Petzing and Dans/Brads decision making. When Amon Ra was in diapers, I was a Lions fan. Maybe he should spend less time on podcasts and more time catching footballs considering his drops this season. They’re entitled to their opinions and so are we. I’m willing to give Petzing a chance. I hope it works out. But Lions fans skepticism is to be expected after the Morton disaster. They’re getting paid millions and millions of dollars and part of that is because of the fans who have stuck with this team through thick and thin. I was there for 0-16 and we have no desire to go back to the basement. So if you want Lions fans to “calm down”, prove us wrong. When Jared shat on the Lions fans for their lack of faith, he proved that their lack of faith was justified almost immediately. I’m glad Lions fans are screaming from the roof tops. I’m glad they’re not just accepting any bs being sold to them. We demand better now because our expectations have risen. 9-8 is not good enough. Not making the playoffs is not good enough. And they need to feel the pressure of that from the fans. We have settled for mediocrity my entire life and we’re over it. ",
