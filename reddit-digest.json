At Bayern Munich, he would certainly have found it easier to adapt to the football scene, because he would have stayed in the same league…  \n  \n**Interviewer:** But he's not going through a good period with Liverpool right now (0 goals and 3 assists in 21 competitive games for Liverpool)?  \n  \n**Müller:** That's true. But that doesn't compare at all to the volume of media attention a player faces when things aren't going well for him at Bayern Munich. Here, you're under pressure every day. As a foreign player, you don't get talked about to the same extent.",
