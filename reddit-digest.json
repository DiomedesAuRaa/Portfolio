It just doesn't feel natural when listening, its hard to pinpoint exactly... \n\nLike I care way less about Bill making wild or even off-base claims or takes because it just feels like a natural random convo he's having with a buddy, and his ability to do that draws out more natural and interesting reactions from his guests which elevates the pod overall, whereas other podcasters just feel like they're making points based on agreed upon outline that they came up with in a pre production meeting.

He can effortlessly draw really niche comparisons for certain team archetypes, player archetypes, and other situational elements of sports. And on top of that, he’ll also mix in some incredibly precise pop culture references to blend into his sports content too. \n\n\nTruly the podfather.",
