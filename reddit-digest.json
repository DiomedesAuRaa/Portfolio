Because the team has not yet started operating as the Las Vegas Athletics, it cannot easily produce the kind of marketplace evidence, such as sales figures, advertising spend, media recognition, and consumer perception, that would normally overcome a descriptiveness refusal.\n\n> There is also a clear legal precedent that prior trademark registrations do not guarantee approval of new trademarks. From the USPTO’s perspective, Oakland Athletics and Las Vegas Athletics are legally different marks, and the agency is well within its rights to hold that line and deny these new trademark applications.\n\n> Still, this case has the potential to push the law in a new direction. At a practical level, it is hard to argue that the public would perceive ‘Las Vegas Athletics’ as anything other than the existing MLB franchise. That opens the door to more creative legal arguments, but pursuing them would likely require an appeal to federal court.\n\n> One other option at this point would be for the team to retain a survey expert. A properly designed consumer perception survey could provide powerful evidence that the public overwhelmingly associates ‘Las Vegas Athletics’ with the Athletics ownership group and its MLB team. That type of data can move the needle with examiners, especially with these types of refusals.\n\n> Do I expect the Athletics to ultimately secure these registrations?\n\n> Yes.",

What could that look like realistically?\n\n  \nIn order to be fair to the owners when relocating their team, we will relocate each team based on their Metropolitan Statistical Area to the Canadian metro area of the same rank. For example: Philadelphia, PA is the 9th largest MSA in America so they will move to Hamilton, ON which is the 9th largest in Canada. We will also relocate the Blue Jays south of the border for fairness.

It’s never been a point in decades because a schedule has never been this level of easy. \n\n1-2 against .500 teams. \n\nDidn’t play literally any of the top 15 defenses apart from Cleveland. No Seattle, Eagles, Chiefs, Lions, broncos, Texans, Rams, Vikings defenses which are all the best in league. \n\nPlayed the 2 outlier teams (Raiders and Jets) who were historically bad, 3 times. \n\nNearly 1/4 of Maye’s passing td’s came against the 2 x Jets games. The second game where the defense with 14 defensive injuries is probably the worst defense in NFL history (jets the last month of the season). \n\nStafford also had the 7th most passing TD’s in nfl history facing 8 teams .500 or better. \n\nThey had the No.1 HARDEST schedule in the league and the Pats had the easiest schedule in the last 832 schedules (26 years). Thats why it’s been brought up.",

Maye is going to get a very well deserved 2nd team all pro. I don’t even mean that sarcastically he really has had a great season.\n\nYou’d think pats fans would be looking ahead to their game this weekend and being all excited about idk trying to go win a Super Bowl?",
