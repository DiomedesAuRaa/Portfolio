Moore was 25 years old.\n\nNew Albany Police Chief Todd Bailey said Moore was found dead of a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound inside the garage of a property in the city. An autopsy is scheduled for Sunday, and the police department is currently investigating the death.\n\nMoore, who starred as a college receiver at Purdue, was drafted in the second round of the 2021 NFL Draft by the Arizona Cardinals. He played three years with the Cardinals before multiple serious knee injuries derailed his career.\n\nHe signed with the Vikings before the 2025 season. In the team’s first preseason game, he tore his ACL. He was not around the facility throughout the season after being placed on injured reserve.\n\n“Rondale Moore was a complete joy to coach,” his college coach, Jeff Brohm, wrote in a statement. “The ultimate competitor that wouldn’t back down from any challenge. Rondale has a work ethic that was unmatched by anyone. A great teammate that would come through in any situation. We all loved Rondale, we loved his smile and competitive edge that always wanted to please everyone he came in contact with. We offer all of our thoughts and prayers to Rondale and his family, we love him very much!!!” \n",
