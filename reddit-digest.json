        "selftext": "After Stew, Cade is the longest-tenured Piston. Drafted as the franchise savior, only to watch the roster around him get torn down and rebuilt every year while the losses pile up. Perpetual lottery trips, historic bad luck—fifth pick three straight years. He misses nearly his entire second season, comes back just in time to be part of the longest losing streak in NBA history.\n\nAnd then it finally turns. A beloved Piston in Tobias Harris returns. The draft picks start hitting. The culture shifts. Suddenly, this is the best team in the East—and Cade is still standing at the center of it all.\n\nThat’s an all-time NBA story arc❤️💙",
