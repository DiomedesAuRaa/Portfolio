        "selftext": "I have always wondered why F1 was so dead set against moveable aerodynamic devices for so long, and today I ran across an explanation. \n\nThe origin was in 1970. Aero was really coming in, and the Lotus 49 was using a rear wing raised way up high, on these spindly supports (think kind of like a Top Fuel dragster). And the supports were attached to the suspension, instead of the body, so the wing would actually move around.  \n\nDuring a race, one of them broke off Jochen Rindt's car, and he crashed. The setup was blamed, and thereafter, the rule was changed so wings had to be attached to the body. (It didn't help that Colin Chapman had a reputation for building cars so light that they posed a hazard to his drivers.)\n\nI'm sure some people already know this, but it was new to me, so I thought I'd post.

He’s tough, he’s physical, he’s smart. Man, he can catch. I mean I just - I love the hands. I love the hands. You could put the ball anywhere, you saw it last week when he caught that touchdown. I mean he’s gotten a lot of touchdowns. I mean compared to receptions and touchdowns, that’s pretty good. But he’s - when you’ve got a guy like that who can catch and he’s a rookie and like I said, he’s just blossomed every single week and in the run game. You know our wideouts, they have to block and they’re the best in football in doing that. But it’s been really cool to see him. I mean he just - and really, he’s not a rookie anymore. And he comes to work every day - that whole unit with (Lions Assistant Head Coach/Wide Receivers) Scottie (Montgomery). He does an unbelievable job with those guys. They all have the same attitude. It’s really a cool thing.”",

That’s loser mentality. Full stop. \n\nWinning cultures don’t tank divisional games. They don’t cheer for losses against rivals. They don’t prioritize hypothetical draft picks over real wins on the field. That’s what bad franchises do, and it’s what the Lions spent decades trying to escape.\n\nBeat the Bears. Sweep Ben Johnson. Take the win, take the pride, and stop pretending losing on purpose is smart. \n\nReal fans want dominance, not draft math.\n\n#OnePride #FTP #FBJ",
