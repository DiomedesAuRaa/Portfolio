He also won a World Championship in 2024.\n\nSince leaving OpTic and joining Falcons, though, it feels like the community has completely moved on. Players like Simp, Shotzzy, aBeZy, HyDra, Huke, etc. are now ranked above him with little debate.\n\nWas this due to role, team situation, meta changes, or just recency bias?

I mean he’s gotten a lot of touchdowns. I mean compared to receptions and touchdowns, that’s pretty good. But he’s - when you’ve got a guy like that who can catch and he’s a rookie and like I said, he’s just blossomed every single week and in the run game. You know our wideouts, they have to block and they’re the best in football in doing that. But it’s been really cool to see him. I mean he just - and really, he’s not a rookie anymore. And he comes to work every day - that whole unit with (Lions Assistant Head Coach/Wide Receivers) Scottie (Montgomery). He does an unbelievable job with those guys. They all have the same attitude. It’s really a cool thing.”",

That’s loser mentality. Full stop. \n\nWinning cultures don’t tank divisional games. They don’t cheer for losses against rivals. They don’t prioritize hypothetical draft picks over real wins on the field. That’s what bad franchises do, and it’s what the Lions spent decades trying to escape.\n\nBeat the Bears.

Cade is comedy for real \n\n\nI remember in the playoffs Mitchell Robinson was at the free-throw line trying to steady himself so he wouldn't throw up another brick and Cade just strolled passed him and clearly said something. His back was to the camera so you couldn't see what but Mitchell's face just dropped like \"C'mon man why would you say that?!\" And then he missed 🤣 I'll forever want to know what he said. ",
