        "selftext": "1894 Yale was the only other college football team besides Indiana to go 16-0, so obviously the were the best team during that entire time period. So let’s say after next season, (Once the 2026 regular season is over) a scientist found a way to bring people back to life and brought the entire 1894 Yale team back. The scientist was able to make them exactly how they were during that 1894 season, (same athleticism and age) and the University of Yale football program decided to get rid of all their current players and add that 1894 team to their new roster.\n\nNow, during the 2026-2027 offseason, that entire Yale team had all that time to be taught the way football works in the modern world, train and weight lift, learn Yale’s current playbook, anything they need to learn to be able to compete for the 2027 season.\n\nThe NCAA then decided to add them into the FBS, as well as ban them from getting any transfers or add any new high school recruits to their roster. They then get added as an independent. The NCAA also allows them to have unlimited practice, and let’s say this is all in a scenario that this 1894 Yale team is fully committed and motivated to playing football again, as well as it is impossible for the players to get injured and the refs have a bias towards them in every game. They also have the easiest schedule out of any FBS team in 2027.\n\nNow this begs the question, how would they perform in the 2027 season? Would they just get belt to ass every single game? Maybe sneak in a win or two?",

        "selftext": "# -------\n\nNorth Dakota State is poised to become the 137th member of the FBS level, starting in the mountain west conference this upcoming season. [^(1)](https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/47870245/sources-north-dakota-state-joins-mountain-west-football) So, who else *could* theoretically join them?  Key word here is *could*, not necessarily will. I used 6 factors in finding the potential teams. You can find them below with some explainers. The schools that meet the minimum criteria are scored > 1. A score of 1.0 means a school meets the minimum FBS requirements. The factors were then very crudely weighted until I got a result I liked\n\n## Factors:\n\n**Enrollment** – this is an obvious one, how many students (and alumni) does a school have to support it. The current lowest enrollment in the FBS is Tulsa, with \\~4000 students.[^(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tulsa)\n\n**Endowment** – this is a bit less obvious. The correlation coefficient for a university’s Endowment and Athletics budget is only 0.27, but this is limited due to the amount of private universities in the FCS, which don’t often share athletics budget information. There is some noise there, and endowment is reflective a schools resource. It will not be weighted heavily. The FBS schools with the lowest endowment is Coastal Carolina[^(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_Carolina_University) with an endowment of \\~$77MM.\n\n**Athletics Revenue** – Probably the most important factor here. Due to the many private FCS schools, I had to give a revenue of $0 if I could not find it, so the results are definitely skewed. I was able to find Harvard’s[^(4)](https://gocrimson.com/documents/2024/10/30/Final_2024_EADA_Survey.pdf) and Villanova’s[^(5)](https://www1.villanova.edu/content/dam/villanova/finance/documents/financialstatements/FinancialStatements24.pdf) after some less than intensive searching. Much of the information came from Knight-Newhouse[^(6)](https://knightnewhousedata.org/fbs)^(.) The FBS school with the lowest revenue is Louisiana-Monroe with \\~$19MM.[^(6)](https://knightnewhousedata.org/fbs)\n\n**Stadium Capacity** – the NCAA used to require FBS schools to average 15K fans to meet eligibility, but as of 2023[^(7)](https://www.texasfootball.com/article/2023/10/31/the-ncaa-announced-new-fbs-requirements-here-are-the-biggest-hurdles-for-fcs-programs#:~:text=Share%20or%20Save%20for%20Later,schools%20wishing%20to%20move%20up.) no longer requires this. I will keep it here as I think it's a fine criteria to have (and it makes the math easier).\n\n**Recent Success** \\- how many times a team has made the FCS Playoff in the past 10 years\n\n## The list:\n\n**Rank**\t|**Team**\t|**Endowment**\t|**Enrollment**\t|**AD Revenue**\t|**Stadium Capacity**\t|**Recent Success**\t|**Score**\n\n**|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|**\n\n| |\\*MEDIAN FCS\\*\t|$173400881.5\t|9258.5\t|$15296024.5\t|11250\t|1\t|1.035\n\n1\t|Harvard\t|$50700000000\t|21613\t|$43636552\t|30323\t|1\t|15.595\n\n2\t|Yale\t|$41400000000\t|12093\t|$0\t|61446\t|1\t|12.53\n\n3\t|Princeton\t|$35800000000\t|8478\t|$0\t|27800\t|0\t|10.135\n\n4\t|Penn\t|$21000000000\t|23374\t|$0\t|52593\t|0\t|7.105\n\n5\t|Columbia\t|$14800000000\t|36649\t|$0\t|17000\t|0\t|5.16\n\n6\t|Cornell\t|$10700000000\t|26284\t|$0\t|21500\t|0\t|3.895\n\n7\t|UC Davis\t|$2000000000\t|40848\t|$50059304\t|10849\t|4\t|3.69\n\n8\t|*Delaware*\t|$1780000000\t|24221\t|$58133283\t|18500\t|4\t|3.52\n\n9\t|Villanova\t|$1310000000\t|9900\t|$65090000\t|12500\t|6\t|3.465\n\n10\t|*North Dakota State*\t|$457000000\t|11592\t|$29948436\t|19000\t|10\t|3.435\n\n11\t|South Dakota State\t|$213000000\t|11465\t|$29836789\t|19340\t|10\t|3.37\n\n12\t|Montana\t|$241600000\t|10811\t|$28970312\t|25200\t|8\t|3.05\n\n13\t|Sacramento State\t|$92991000\t|31451\t|$43065314\t|21195\t|4\t|2.985\n\n14\t|Montana State\t|$264000000\t|17144\t|$28397789\t|20767\t|7\t|2.925\n\n15\t|Weber State\t|$219555666\t|29914\t|$18433998\t|17000\t|6\t|2.76\n\n16\t|North Dakota\t|$422100000\t|15019\t|$36995926\t|12283\t|6\t|2.745\n\n17\t|New Hampshire\t|$475100000\t|14784\t|$33102605\t|11015\t|6\t|2.64\n\n18\t|Illinois State\t|$224700000\t|21546\t|$31460587\t|13391\t|5\t|2.56\n\n19\t|Brown\t|$7200000000\t|10737\t|$0\t|20000\t|0\t|2.545\n\n20\t|Dartmouth\t|$7900000000\t|6746\t|$0\t|15000\t|0\t|2.53\n\n21\t|Stony Brook\t|$390500000\t|25710\t|$40920954\t|12300\t|2\t|2.3\n\n22\t|Tennessee State\t|$91100000\t|8198\t|$20209138\t|68798\t|1\t|2.165\n\n23\t|*Missouri State*\t|$193000000\t|23418\t|$34252090\t|17500\t|2\t|2.14\n\n24\t|South Dakota\t|$328500000\t|9971\t|$25893184\t|10000\t|5\t|2.1\n\n25\t|Richmond\t|$3200000000\t|3914\t|$0\t|8400\t|5\t|2.1\n\n26\t|Northern Arizona\t|$198200000\t|28194\t|$28121139\t|15300\t|2\t|2.09\n\n27\t|William & Mary\t|$1500000000\t|9517\t|$36410837\t|12259\t|2\t|2.07\n\n28\t|Northern Iowa\t|$163000000\t|9021\t|$22170455\t|16000\t|5\t|2.065\n\n29\t|Cal Poly\t|$285300000\t|22000\t|$43594326\t|11075\t|1\t|2.01\n\n30\t|Lehigh\t|$2200000000\t|7692\t|$0\t|16000\t|4\t|1.875\n\n31\t|Idaho\t|$465000000\t|11849\t|$24035157\t|16000\t|3\t|1.855\n\n32\t|Tarleton\t|$42000000\t|14092\t|$28200122\t|24000\t|2\t|1.845\n\n33\t|Rhode Island\t|$203000000\t|18061\t|$37478061\t|5180\t|2\t|1.845\n\n34\t|Southern Illinois\t|$171801763\t|18107\t|$19924295\t|15276\t|3\t|1.84\n\n35\t|Youngstown State\t|$321500000\t|11076\t|$21696473\t|20650\t|3\t|1.835\n\n36\t|Chattanooga\t|$147100000\t|11775\t|$22565863\t|20668\t|3\t|1.825\n\n37\t|Lamar\t|$161000000\t|17850\t|$23835722\t|16000\t|2\t|1.73\n\n38\t|Eastern Kentucky\t|$78800000\t|14324\t|$25201250\t|20000\t|2\t|1.72\n\n39\t|Towson\t|$87800000\t|22294\t|$30232859\t|11000\t|1\t|1.675\n\n40\t|Stephen F.

        "selftext": "This is not a shitpost. This is a real thing that happened, and if the Cardinals ever want to win again they need to reconcile with their history.\n\nThe NFL first expanded to the west coast in 1946 to compete with the new AAFC, moving the Cleveland Rams to Los Angeles. In 1946, the Chicago Cardinals traveled to Los Angeles to play the Rams. But airplanes were pretty expensive and ownership didn’t want to pay for that, so they took the train from Chicago to LA. \n\nThe two routes to go from Chicago to LA in the 1940s were to go straight west to Omaha, then from there to Salt Lake City and down through Las Vegas to LA, or to go southwest to Kansas City, then through New Mexico and Arizona on the way to LA. And a Chicago Tribune [article](https://img.newspapers.com/img/img?user=17312055&id=369962467&clippingId=184577717&width=750&height=1750&crop=5278_332_750_1750&rotation=0&iat=eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjM2OTk2MjQ2NywiaWF0IjoxNzcxMDc5MTUxLCJleHAiOjE3NzExNjU1NTF9.Wl7v4KSm0gkZ8SL6YjbEZTApHsF7wLvY7soxKU1ChTOofNAemgNhOQLNpH9J_dPdRt_wdLlB2EYCQfWu3ZlOwg) from November 12, 1946 says the Cards took the Chicago & North Western railway for their game with the Rams. The C&NW went to Omaha but not to Kansas City in 1940, which means the Cardinals took the northern route and avoided Arizona in 1946.\n\nThe next year, the Cardinals and Rams played in LA in October. They again took the train, and on the Thursday before the game the Tribune had a [piece](https://img.newspapers.com/img/img?user=17312055&id=369888188&clippingId=191269849&width=782&height=2692&crop=3115_279_782_2692&rotation=0) about the Cards prepping for the Rams while on the train in Salt Lake City. So they avoided Arizona this time too.\n\nBut when they arrived in LA, Jeff Burkett, the Cardinals’ star punter (he had by far the [most](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1947/punting.htm) yards/punt in ‘47) had appendicitis and needed immediate surgery. He missed the Rams game to recover, and while the rest of the team took the train back, the Cards ownership got Burkett on a plane back to Chicago a few days later. This was a direct flight from LA to Chicago, which does indeed go through Arizona.\n\nWhich means that the first Cardinals player to enter the state of Arizona as an active player was Jeff Burkett flying on [United Flight 608](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Air_Lines_Flight_608) on October 24th, 1947. While flying over Arizona, the plane caught on fire, a wing fell off, and it exploded when it hit the ground. Witnesses described the explosion as akin to the photos they’d seen of Hiroshima two years prior. Everybody on board died.\n\nThe postscript to this is that a few weeks later a different flight of the same aircraft (a DC-6) was flying from California to Chicago, and while over Arizona this one also caught on fire. But this time the pilot managed to land the plane safely, where FAA investigators studied the DC-6 and found a design flaw. The investigation into the crash of United 608 was closed.\n\nIt’s obvious to me what happened here, and hopefully it’s obvious to you too. The state of Arizona took Jeff Burkett as a blood sacrifice, then covered up its murder of him by staging another “crash”. In exchange for Burkett's life, the Cardinals would win the championship in 1947, but would then be indebted to Arizona. \n\nThe Cardinals did win the championship in 1947 and never won again, and now Arizona has them trapped and they never will win again. I don't know how we can begin to solve this, but if we want to free the Cardinals from the grasp of Arizona, acknowledging the truth is a good place to start.",

And when you’ve kind of driven a certain way for the last 15 years, it’s pretty tough to undo some of those things, especially when some of them are lifting on straights or stuff like that. Obviously, as a driver, you never want to be lifting at any point. But yeah, I think, even without some of the challenges that we’ve got and the things we need to address as a sport, ultimately, they are cars that are slower, and then have less downforce and probably more power out of the corners, so they’re always going to feel difficult to drive and tricky. That aspect is kind of one thing, and then there’s all the aspects that are new and need some reform.\n\n>Starts need to be addressed, because, probably as we’ve all seen, it’s a pretty complicated process now to have a safe start, let alone a competitive one.\n\n>The thing is, everyone’s going to need different things for the start. And to be completely honest with you, I’m not sure any of us know exactly what we need yet.\n\n>I’m sure we’ll find a way to do a proper start. It’s just that the difference between a good and bad start last year was you got a bit of wheelspin or you had a bad reaction time, whereas this year, it could be, effectively, like an F2 race, where you almost go into anti-stall or something. You’re not just losing five meters or so. You can be losing six or seven spots, if it goes well.\n\n>And there’s plenty of topics to address. Starts, Overtaking is certainly going to be different as well. DRS was obviously just a pure advantage used to gain, whereas now, with the energy boost, you’ve obviously got to harvest that extra energy somehow and then deploy it, which with some of the rules in place, is not always that straightforward.\n\n>I think following is very similar to last year, in all honesty, which is not a big surprise to me, but there’s definitely a lot of things to talk about and address before Melbourne.\n\n>There’s so many things just from an even borderline safety point of view that need to be kind of figured out on track, that do need addressing.",

Huge lift of. 50% power from ICE, 50% power from hybrid. Discrepancy in top speed and acceleration between the different straights because of hybrid strategies.\n\nDrivers went crazy at acceleration with hybrid and cumulated power around 1000hp for 870kg. Then the electric engine shut off and they were driving cars with 500hp. Less power than LMP2. On Le Mans, driving through the pits saved enough energy to reach 30km/h more on the next straight than going through the start / finish line.\n\nBy then, no LMP1 driver complained. They had the most exciting cars ever at every corner exit. The fasters sport prototypes ever. The best on track battles since the Peugeot / Audi duel, or if we go back, since the 90's.",
