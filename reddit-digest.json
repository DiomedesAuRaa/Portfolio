For first-round picks, the fifth-year option amount isn’t fixed just by draft slot anymore. Instead, it has four tiers:\n\nBasic Tier: lowest salary, based mostly on positional averages.\n\nPlaytime Tier: higher than basic, based on playing time thresholds.\n\nOne Pro Bowl Tier: earns a salary equal to the transition tag at his position.\n\nMultiple Pro Bowls Tier: earns a salary equal to the franchise tag at his position. \n\nFWIW, alternate Pro Bowl selections do not count towards this. So Drake Maye for example, who was like the 8th backup Pro Bowler last year but a legit Pro Bowler this year, only has one pro Bowl counting towards his 5th year option raise.",

        "selftext": "A non-punting stat that I love is turnover worthy plays. Interception counts fluctuate but TWP give an idea of how often a passer is putting the ball in harms way. But, this made me wonder, who is the luckiest? Which QBs have been lucky this year? That was the goal here.\n\nTo do that, I utilized PFF. PFF counts a TWP as \"a pass that has a high percentage chance to be intercepted or a poor job of taking care of the ball and fumbling.\" Note the last part, it includes fumbled plays as well. Unfortunately, I did not know a quick and easy way to to get individual player lost fumble numbers, so I fudged it a little. I looked at the individual player fumble grades, then took their compliments (compliment of 70 is 30, 65 and 35), multiplied by 1/100 to make it a percent, then multiplied that by the fumble count and added it to the interception count. Its not perfect, don't shoot me, but I think its good enough for this curiosity exercise of giving an idea of how often a fumble is attributed to the QB. I then took the new combined turnover count and divided it by the total TWP. Lastly, I made that a percent. Simple maths, nothing groundbreaking.\n\nThe higher the Luck number, the more often a players TWP results in a true turnover. 1.00 is dead even. For some players, they have more turnovers than TWP. Joe Burrow is truly unlucky.\n\nMinimum 15 aimed passes",

I built a spoiler-free rating tool called ReplayRank that rates games **0-100** using a volatility-based formula (clutch minutes, lead changes, pace, etc.) - **without showing the final score**.\n\n\n\nI plotted team season data **as of Dec 23, 2025**, and the results are… controversial.\n\n\n\n**The Matrix Insights**\n\n\n\n**The “Boring” Elites (Bottom-Right):**\n\n• **OKC** (**86.7%** win rate / **52.8** avg excitement).\n\nMy algorithm “hates” them because they’re too dominant. Blowouts kill late-game volatility. Great for OKC fans, less suspense for neutral viewers.\n\n• Another example in this quadrant: **NYK** (**70.0%** / **59.0**).\n\n\n\n**The True Elites (Top-Right):** teams that win *and* keep it dramatic\n\n• **DEN** (**72.4%** / **69.6**)\n\n• **SAS** (**73.3%** / **66.3**)\n\n• Also notable: **MIN** (**66.7%** / **70.7**)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/89m7umm6uc9g1.png?width=2317&format=png&auto=webp&s=6515abf23df49022db6b76c79119efc0de65c0a4\n\n**The Darlings (Top-Left):** not great records, but consistently sweaty games\n\n• **DAL** (**38.7%** / **69.9**)\n\n• **CHI** (**48.3%** / **69.1**)\n\n\n\n**The “Basement” (Bottom-Left):** you know them - losing *and* low suspense\n\n• **BKN** (**32.1%** / **52.2**)\n\n• **WAS** (**17.9%** / **53.3**)\n\n\n\n**Updates based on feedback**\n\n• **Score breakdowns** (Volatility / Player impact / Clutch) so you can see the “why”\n\n• **Fan voting** to flag games the algorithm underrated**.**\n\n\n\nIf you’re watching the Christmas slate and trying to stay spoiler-free, I can share an interactive version on request.\n\n\n\nHappy Holidays.",

I'd see him on the 27th or 28th usually, with his extended family\n\nBut all Christmas Eve my mind and heart felt so heavy with thoughts and memories of him, which took me by surprise. Kept thinking back to all of our mad cap family Christmasses growing up, in a family of 7. The chaos, carnage, frivolity, arguments, board games, Christmas telly. Staying up late to watch the Boxing Day test. My dad worked a lot and sometimes even worked Christmas, but then there would be that moment he came home, too\n. \nI think it gets me too, what he's lost. We've lost him, but it hurts to know that he'll never again have the joy of Christmas, of seeing your family, of eating, drinking and being merry. He had a sweet smile, and I remember that image of him sitting back late on Christmas evening, heart full of good cheer, a big smile on his face\n\nMiss him more than I realise",

This time of year just becomes a period where im reminded of what I lost.\n\nMy family are off visiting each of my sisters, going home to home doing mini Christmases with each group of kids and I'm sat at home just being miserable watching shit on TV\n\nI know in an ideal world I should step up and be that fun uncle for them who loves the holidays and creates those memories for them but I really fucking hate this time of year and just stewing in my own sadness has become the norm for me now\n\nEven my partner knows to just leave me alone over the holidays and I feel so fucking shitty everyone has to experience this version of me but I really dont know how to look at this month and not feel anger and sadness",
