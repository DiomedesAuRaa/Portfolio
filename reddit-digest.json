This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.\n\nAlso make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).\n\nAre you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.\n\nRemember to keep it civil and welcoming!

Defenses packing the paint, sagging off of Ausar and Harris, taking away the Cade/Duren lob and trapping Cade later in the game. \n\nEvery shot that he takes that isn't a wide open dunk is essentially a turnover, or he's gonna go to the line and probably miss both free throws.  Teams in the playoffs will exploit this. \n\nPersonally I almost like what I'm seeing from Ron Holland more at this point in the season. He's a great defender himself, he's not afraid to shoot the ball (even if he's not the best shooter), he's a much better shot creator, and I trust him more at the free throw line. He's gives up a bit in size but the trade off is worth it. \n\nThe Pistons might have a make a tough decision with Ausar and either move him to the bench or even test the market for him to see if they can upgrade their shooting on the perimeter.

        "selftext": "During this lull between Christmas and New Year's, I got to thinking about the \"Shakey's game\" (which I have always understood to be the first Wild Card game on Saturday). I wondered what the furthest any team to play in a Shakey's game has ever gotten in the playoffs.\n\nBecause I have far too much free time on my hands, I decided to look at every Shakey's game since the 2000-01 playoffs to find out exactly that. I also found a bunch of other interesting trivia (to sports nerds and sports nerds only) that I thought I should share here.\n\nSince 2000:\n\n\\- 1 Shakey's game participant has won the Super Bowl (2006 Colts)\n\n\\- 2 participants have made it to the Super Bowl but lost (2008 Cardinals, 2021 Bengals)\n\n\\- 4 participants made it to a Conference Championship Game but lost (2001 Eagles, 2009 Jets, 2020 Bills, 2022 49ers)\n\n\\- The other 18 Shakey's game winners immediately flamed out in the Divisional round\n\n\\- The Houston Texans (unsurprisingly) own the Shakey's game, having appeared in it \\*literally\\* every time they've made the playoffs -- 8 appearances with a 6-2 record. Though it seems they'll be spared this year by either Carolina or Tampa Bay.\n\n\\- The Shakey's game is played more often between AFC teams (17 times) than NFC teams (7 times) which probably says something about who the NFL thinks the most interesting teams are. Between 2015 and 2021, the Shakey's game featured only AFC teams.\n\n\\- Andy Reid's Chiefs playoff debut was in a Shakey's game -- a game in which the Chiefs were on the losing end of the second biggest comeback in NFL playoff history\n\n\\- The \"Beast Quake\" game was a Shakey's game\n\n\\- Josh Allen, Joe Burrow, and Brock Purdy each got their first playoff win in a Shakey's game\n\n\\- And until recently, Philip Rivers' final game was a Shakey's game\n\n\\- The last time the Dolphins won a playoff game was a Shakey's game\n\n\\- There have been 2 Shakey's shutouts (2002 Jets beat Colts 41-0, 2015 Chiefs beat Texans 30-0)\n\n\\- Only one Shakey's game has gone to overtime (2019 Texans beat Bills 22-19)\n\nSorry if that was a lot. I had just compiled all this information and felt I needed to unload it somehow without sounding like a deranged person to my friends and family.",
