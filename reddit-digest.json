        "selftext": "I might be in the minority here, but Michael Jordan’s role with NBC has been pretty underwhelming to me so far. When NBC announced him as a “special contributor,” I genuinely expected more than what we’ve gotten - maybe live appearances, real analysis, or at least fresh insight on today’s NBA.\nInstead, it feels like NBC keeps recycling the same pre-taped interview clips, and that’s about it. For someone of Jordan’s stature, the buildup versus the actual output feels way off.\nI’m curious how others see it:\nDo you think this is NBC overselling the role? Or were expectations for MJ just unrealistic to begin with? And more broadly, do legends like Jordan even need to be doing TV roles like this, or does it rarely live up to the hype?",

Just thought it was interesting.\n\n**EDIT: Adding more context since this ended up getting posted on Twitter. I didn’t take a picture because they were dressed normally and only had badges that said “Brooklyn Nets Media.” They weren’t decked out head to toe in Nets gear where it would’ve been obvious or easy to snap a photo without being weird about it lol.**\n\n**Obviously, take anything you read on the internet with a grain of salt. I’m not asking anyone to blindly believe me. That said, multiple people around me saw them as well. I’ve been part of this community for nearly a decade, have worked with the Pistons hundreds of times specifically for this subreddit, and I really have no reason to make up something this random.
