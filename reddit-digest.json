        "selftext": "If you just look at Diego Pavia without the personality and antics:\n\n* Zero D1 offers, only two D2 offers out of high school\n* Played at a community college and transferred to New Mexico State, which is a historically bad program that is 5th worst all-time in win percentage\n* Led them to their first double-digit win season since 1960\n* Transferred to Vanderbilt, another historically bad program that is bottom 30 all-time in win percentage, 7th worst all-time for Power 5, and worst all-time in the SEC\n* Leads them to their first winning season in a decade, then their first double-digit win season in history. \n* Plays some genuinely good and exciting football with a fun to watch playstyle. Heisman runner-up\n* Is 5'9, scrappy, and would be the shortest QB to ever play in the NFL\n\nHe would have been the biggest slam-dunk, easy-to-root-for underdog ever if he wasn't such an ass. You literally could not write a better underdog story if you tried. And nobody hated Vanderbilt as a program either, they would've been as universally well-liked as Indiana if Pavia had even been half the man that Fernando is. Absolutely generational fumble tbh. ",
