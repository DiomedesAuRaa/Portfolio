        "author": "jlittman93",
        "score": 1460,
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1q1y9nd/insight_from_an_indiana_alum_on_what_were/",
        "selftext": "I see a lot of non-Indiana fans on here being like, “I can’t imagine what Indiana fans must be feeling right now.” So I figured I’d give it a shot. Bear with me here lol. \n\nTo be an Indiana fan is to know misery. And I mean misery. Season after season of endless losing, coach after coach and nothing changing. I’m not from Indiana. I only started watching the team when I was a senior in high school back in 2010 and knew I’d be heading to Bloomington the next fall. The first IU game I watched, ever, was a game at Wisconsin. We lost, 83-20.\n\nOver my four years in Bloomington, IU’s football team went 14-34. With losses to the likes of Ball State (twice), Navy (twice), North Texas and even Bowling Green. Bowling Green! But year after year you’d get your hopes up because it’s college football, only for this team to find a way to crush your hopes yet again. It’s a feeling every IU football fan shares. \n\nThere was always a saying around Indiana football. “Never lost a tailgate!” And like, yeah, it’s funny and all, but even up until the early days of Cignetti last season, fans would be extremely late to games or just not even show up because they’d still be out on the tailgate fields. And if they did make it into the stadium, they’d be gone by halftime. It was a desolate existence.\n\nBut there’s always been a part of me that’s dreamed for something like this. Because being a part of the Rose Bowl is the pinnacle of what Big Ten football has been all about over the decades. And we’ve been locked out of that for so, so long. I remember being thrilled about playing at UCLA last season because that would probably be the only time ever IU would play (at) the Rose Bowl. For reference, the last time IU played in the Rose Bowl Game back in 1968, my mom was a newborn. I’m 32 years old now.\n\nSo yeah, everything under Cig has been an absolute fever dream. I remember writing a whole thing in my Notes app the evening before we played Notre Dame in the CFP about how this all felt like a dream as an IU football fan. Clearly, I didn’t know what was coming. \n\nThis season in its entirely has felt so surreal. As an Indiana fan, there’s a constant nagging feeling that this success will be fleeting. That some moment will occur and all of this will be taken away. But here’s the thing. A Heisman Trophy winner, a Big Ten Championship and a Rose Bowl victory are forever, regardless of what happens over the next two games. \n\nSo let me just go back to what happened yesterday in Pasadena one last time. This was a pilgrimage for so many IU fans. Something we’ve all dreamt of for 55+ years and never thought would be reality — let alone doing so as the No. 1 team in the rankings. Just being there was the win. That stadium yesterday was more than 70% Indiana fans because  of just how rare of an occurrence this really is for us.\n\nAnd then for the team to go out and do THAT. I remember chanting “WE WANT BAMA” often as a student back when we’d be getting trounced by Wisconsin or Michigan State or whoever. This was Alabama, though. And for IU to not just win, but utterly destroy Alabama and give them their worst loss in 27 years and their worst postseason loss ever? And in the Rose Bowl of all games?! There were points while I was watching at home yesterday with my wife (who I met in Bloomington) and our newborn daughter that I couldn’t stop laughing in joy and disbelief at how ridiculous and how surreal this was that this was actually happening. It was literally a fever dream come true.\n\nI know a lot of college football fans are envious of Indiana and its success right now. But if there’s anything to take from this post, it’s that it’s been absolute hell to get to this point. And for yesterday to have happened, regardless of what happens in Atlanta next Friday, it’s something every Indiana football fan is going to remember for the rest of their lives. \n\nTL;DR: Big, big happy. Go Hoosiers!\n",

        "selftext": ">It’s amazing how much has changed in three years. Think back to the 2022 NBA All-Star Game: Three precocious young point guards — the Atlanta Hawks’ Trae Young, the Memphis Grizzlies’ Ja Morant and the Charlotte Hornets’ LaMelo Ball — made the squad and played on the same team in Cleveland.\n\n>In each case, the future for both player and team seemed bright, but fast forward to 2025, and that’s not the case. Young’s Hawks made the Eastern Conference finals in 2021, Ball’s Hornets won 43 games in 2022 and Morant’s Grizzlies were the second seed in the Western Conference in consecutive seasons. Unbelievably, none of the three have won a playoff series since 2022. This doesn’t look like the year the streak will end, with the Hawks and Grizzlies in Play-In territory and Ball’s Hornets again headed for the draft lottery.\n\n>Similarly, all three have seen their career trajectories go sideways, even if it’s happened more in slow motion than in one rapid swoon. Injuries have plagued all three, but unserious defense and stalled development trajectories are also to blame. Ball has been the topic of trade rumors and even a rumored trade demand; Young is a potential free agent this summer whose team has made no serious move toward extending his contract; Morant’s unreliability was a key factor in Memphis’ offseason reset, and he’s already been suspended by his own team this season.\n\n>There might be other individual players who have been more disappointing this season, but as a class, the Southern point guard trio has moved into a league of its own. As a result, those three top my All-Disappointment Team for 2025-26.\n\n>My squad is a list of players who have done the most to fall short of our hopes and expectations, however misplaced they might have been. While I focused more on significant players on big contracts, I sprinkled in a few middle-class guys and developmental cases as well.\n\n>We’re barely one-third of the way into an 82-game season. Things can and do change, and inevitably, some players will play themselves off this list. But as 2026 begins, here are the envelopes. (Stats as of Wednesday afternoon.)\n\n**NBA All-Disappointment Team:**\n\n- Ja Morant\n- LaMelo Ball\n- Trae Young\n- Darius Garland\n- Paolo Banchero\n- Draymond Green\n- Jared McCain\n- Herb Jones\n- Cam Johnson\n- Guerschon Yabusele\n- Indiana’s Youth\n\n\nSource: https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6930954/2026/01/01/nba-season-2025-2026-disappointments/",

James was the most-viewed NBA player on social media last season. But on Dec. 23, he dropped to fourth behind Doncic, San Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama and Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry on an NBA list of the 10 most-viewed players this season.\n\nPerhaps James is lagging behind because he missed training camp and the start of the season with sciatica. What’s worth noting is that James’ biggest historical rival, Michael Jordan, had a drop from All-Star grace at the end of his career, too.\n\nAt 39, Jordan wasn’t voted by fans as an Eastern Conference All-Star starter during his 2002-03 swan song season. East All-Star coach Isiah Thomas encouraged a willing Vince Carter to give up his starting spot to Jordan during the 2003 NBA All-Star Game. Jordan, then playing for the Washington Wizards, was celebrated during a halftime performance by legendary singer Mariah Carey.\n\nUnlike Jordan, it’s uncertain if this will be James’ last NBA season. There is certainly nothing more for James to accomplish. He is the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, a four-time NBA champion, and his son, Bronny, is also in the league.\n\n\nSource: https://andscape.com/features/is-lebron-james-nba-all-star-game-voting-a-sign-of-the-times/\n\n",

He wanted to be the coach and the general manager. He stood around and held Bob Hill's hand every day, saying, \"Okay, you've got to do this now. It's time for you to listen to me.\" If Hill didn't do it, Popovich would jump his ass, and so HIll would turn around and jump somebody else's ass. Shit flows downhill, and it seemed like I was always at the bottom.\n\nOther than the playoffs I didn't have much of a problem with Bob Hill. He was being used as much as I was. Popovich wanted to be the guy who tamed Dennis Rodman, and he tried to use Hill to do his dirty work. That was Popovich's big challenge. Mr. Military was going to make me a good little boy, a good soldier. He lost sight of everything else, and then when he decided he couldn't do anything with me, he badmouthed me and gave me away for next to nothing. Then he pretended it was good for the team.”\n\nHere’s a much longer background on his time in San Antonio from the book, blaming their management for not being able to beat the Rockets in the WCF and ultimately win a title. This was all before Pop became a 5 time champ head coach on the Spurs, or even appointed himself to that position:\n\nAfter the second game of the Western Conference Finals against Houston - after we fell behind two games to none with two losses at home - Avery Johnson stood up in the locker room, in front of the whole team and most of all the team's management, and said, \"We can't wait for David Robinson to take us, because he ain't going to be there for us.\"\n\nDavid Robinson was there, sitting right in the middle of everyone. When Avery was finished, David was still sitting there. He sat there and took it.\n\nWe lost that series in six games, and the Rockets went on to sweep the Orlando Magic in four games to win the title. I guess you could say, based on that, we were the second-best team in the NBA. That's not good enough, though, because I think we could have - and should have - beaten the Rockets.\n\nI got blamed for losing that series, of course. Everyone says I sold out the Spurs, that I didn't play, that I was a major distraction. It's gotten to the point where the incidents in those two play-off series have become the defining point in my career.\n\nWhere was David Robinson in the Houston series? He got eaten alive by Hakeem Olajuwon that whole series. They asked me to guard Olajuwon, and I refused. Bob Hill came up to me and asked if I would take Hakeem in the first half, and I said no. I would have taken him in the second half, but not the first. Any coach will tell you you don't put your best defensive player on the other team's best offensive player in the first half. You put it all on the line in the second half. That's how it worked with Chuck Daly in Detroit, and I know that's how Phil Jackson feels in Chicago.\n\nWhat you try to do is contain the guy in the first half and make sure your best defensive player doesn't get into foul trouble early. You've got be physical with Hakeem, and I'm no good if I've got three or four fouls in the first half. Then every time I touch somebody, it's a foul. Against Los Angeles in the semifinals I couldn't touch Elden Campbell without being called for a foul, and Elden Campbell doesn't get the breaks from the refs like Hakeem does.\n\nSo if you want me to guard him in the second, half, fine. David got into foul trouble against Hakeem just by falling down. David asked me for help, and I told him right to his fucking face, \"I am not going down there.\" I was not going to help him. He didn't say anything to me, because there was nothing he could say. Before those games, he looked so fucking scared in the locker room, he couldn't stop shaking.\n\nThey asked me to double-team Olajuwon, and I refused. The way the defense was drawn up, there was no way I was going to be able to get back down inside when my man was at the top of the key or way out on the baseline. The defense didn't make sense, and I told Bob Hill this. He just looked at me and said, \"This is the defense we're going to run.\"\n\nIn practice every day Coach Hill would say \"David, you think you can play Olajuwon straight up?\" David would just shrug and say, \"You all can come down and help if you want.\" Never once did he say he could take him by himself. This guy was the MVP of the league, and they were paying him $8 million a year. He needed to step up and at least say he could do it by himself. He was supposed to be the one leading this team.\n\nThose guys screwed me over for two years, and then they came to me and asked me to bail their asses out. That's what it came down to. I did what I had to do. I got them to the Western Conference Finals. I got them there, and we should have gone further.\n\nI helped that team, but they didn't listen to me until it was too late. We lost the first two games - at home, even - because the defense we were running was ridiculous. David was getting killed inside, and Robert Horry was killing us from the outside.\n\nDo you want to know who changed the defense for the next two games, after we got to Houston? I did. I saw what we were doing wrong, and I set out to change it. I finally got Bob Hill to see it my way, and it worked. David played Hakeem straight up. Hakeem got what he was going to get anyway, but we stopped everybody else. That's the whole key to stopping them: Give Hakeem what he wants and clam down on everybody else. It's not that hard to figure out.\n\nWe were heading back to San Antonio for Game 5, tied at two games. Even though we started out the series so badly, we were going home having to win two out of three, with two of them - Game 5 and Game 7 - at home. It looked like we finally had our act together.\n\nThe biggest problem in San Antonio was Gregg Popovich, the general manager. He wanted to be the coach and the general manager. He stood around and held Bob Hill's hand every day, saying, \"Okay, you've got to do this now. It's time for you to listen to me.\" If Hill didn't do it, Popovich would jump his ass, and so HIll would turn around and jump somebody else's ass. Shit flows downhill, and it seemed like I was always at the bottom.\n\nOther than the playoffs I didn't have much of a problem with Bob Hill. He was being used as much as I was. Popovich wanted to be the guy who tamed Dennis Rodman, and he tried to use Hill to do his dirty work. That was Popovich's big challenge. Mr. Military was going to make me a good little boy, a good soldier. He lost sight of everything else, and then when he decided he couldn't do anything with me, he badmouthed me and gave me away for next to nothing. Then he pretended it was good for the team.\n\nI can understand that the Spurs didn't give me the contract I had signed in Detroit before the 1990 season. Nobody made me sign it, and it turned out to be a bad deal for me. It wasn't the Spurs' fault the market went crazy and I was left out in the cold. But none of that matters, because the Spurs said they were going to give me $7 million a year, and they went back on their promise. I could have lived with it if they had never said anything about the contract, but they did. I went into the office, and Popovich said. \"We'll take care of you.\" Then he went to the papers and said he'd never said anything like that, and he'd never heard about a new contract. Would you be pissed off if your boss treated you like this? Of course you would. Everybody would.\n\nAfter I left, the Spurs took care of Sean Elliott and David Robinson. They tore up their contracts and renegotiated to make sure those two stayed with the team through their whole careers. So what I was asking for wasn't something they'd never heard of, or thought of. I didn't want a contract that would keep me there my whole career. I know I'm not as young as those guys are - that's why I just wanted a two-year deal that would make up for all I'd given back to the team and the NBA. That wasn't there for me, though.\n\nIn San Antonio, it all came down to this: I got sold out by the players, the coaches, and the management. All up and down the organization I got sold out. I was out there on an island, an easy target for everything. The Spurs traded me to the Chicago Bulls for center Will Perdue, a guy with no game. Straight up for Will Perdue, bro. That's how much San Antonio wanted to get rid of me.\n\nSo what happens when we go back home? Hill decided to go back to the defense we were running in the first two games. It was unbelievable. We went back to double-teaming way outside and getting our ass kicked inside. Then we switched up and collapsed inside so they'd throw it out to the shooter - Horry - and he killed us on three-pointers. We made Horry a star in that series.\n\nThe Rockets beat us two straight and went to the Finals. I was so pissed off, I couldn't believe it. After the Spurs traded me, Bob Hill described my season by saying, \"Dennis did not ride with us on the team bus to the first practice of the year, and he wasn't with us after the last game of the playoffs. You take it from there.\"",

        "selftext": "Hello and Happy New Year to r/baseball. It is 2026, pitchers and catchers start reporting in a little over a month, and our hearts collectively gleam with ~~cholesterol buildup~~ hope that this will be the year that greatness happens. By which I of course mean successfully playing an interesting MLB team name in a game of Scrabble\\*.\n\nA few notes that many of you won't read:\n\n* For those of you who may not be familiar with Scrabble (and/or play with so many house rules that you've completely forgotten the actual rules of the game), a play is made by using the 7 tiles in your tile rack to construct a single legal word on the board, where that word must be in a spot where it connects to at least one other word (unless you are going first) and where it does not result in the creation of any illegal words.\n* In deciding whether or not a word is legal, I am using the [official Scrabble dictionary](https://scrabble.merriam.com/). If you want to gripe about whether or not your team's name is allowed, for the love of all that is holy please direct those comments to them and not to me.\n* I will be using the teams' official names as stated on [mlb.com](http://mlb.com/), and no short versions or nicknames, with two caveats. First, where a team name is two words, I am ignoring the spacing if doing so results in an otherwise-playable word, so Toronto fans finally catch a break. Second, I am open to using either the singular or plural of each team name to the extent it might matter.\n* I am only considering plays of the team name, and not situations where the team name might be incidentally formed by playing a different word. This means that we are only considering playing the word \"met\" as such, and not playing something like \"quartz\" off of \"me\" and incidentally forming \"met\" as a consequence.\n* While \"cool\"-ness is inherently subjective, I consider in this calculation the Scrabble score for the team name, the likelihood of getting the 50-point bonus for using all 7 letters, any exotic/high-point letters in the team name, and such other factors as I will describe in probably too much detail below. Listed scores are for the pluralized official team name unless otherwise indicated.\n* As always, these rankings are just for fun, and do not necessarily reflect my feelings vis-a-vis these teams, their players, their ownership, or their fans (unless I explicitly say otherwise).\n\n\\* Scrabble is a registered trademark of Hasbro, Inc. in the U.S. and Canada, but I'm not going to try to type the (R) symbol every time, so Hasbro can just go bite me. \n\n**Tier One: Not Legal Scrabble Words** (but I'll rank 'em anyway)\n\n**30: Houston Astros** (6 points) -- Neither \"[astro](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/astro)\" nor \"[astros](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/astros)\" is recognized as a legal Scrabble word; and moreover it isn't even worth fighting about because it would be such a crappy play.  \n\n**29: Philadelphia Phillies** (13 points) -- None of \"[phil](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/phil),\" \"[philly](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/philly),\" \"[phillie](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/phillie),\" or \"[phillies](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/phillies)\" are legal, to what I hope is no one's surprise. Before anyone asks, I'm not going to consider \"filly.\" And do you really want to be fillies, guys? Young female horses generally considered too young to breed despite being sexually mature? Is that what you REALLY want?\n\n**28: New York Yankees** (14 points) -- Neither \"[yankee](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/yankee)\" nor \"[yankees](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/yankees)\" is playable, which I admit I was moderately surprised to learn. If I relaxed the rules and allowed \"yank,\" that would jump them all the way up to Tier 4, but this isn't Vietnam. This is r/baseball and we have rules. And that rug really tied the room together.\n\n**27: Boston Red Sox** (14 points)\n\n**26: Chicago White Sox** (21 points) -- In what will be fantastic news for Bostonian and Southsider Scrabble enthusiasts, \"sox,\" standing alone, is indeed [Scrabble-legal](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/sox). However, no singular or plural permutation of whitesock/x or redsock/x is similarly playable. Which is really too bad for the White Sox in particular, which otherwise would be a fantastic Scrabble play.\n\n**Tier Two: How My Idiot Sister Plays Scrabble**\n\n**25: Cincinnati Reds** (5 points) -- Literally the lowest-possible Scrabble score for a full team name.\n\n**24: New York Mets** (met) (5 points) -- \"Mets\" is not a legal play, so the score listed is for \"met,\" which is the type of word one plays to communicate that they are not interested in playing Scrabble anymore. \n\n**23: San Francisco Giants** (7 points)\n\n**22: Los Angeles Angels** (7 points) -- Fun fact: I got nearly all the way to the end of these rankings before realizing I had forgotten the Angels. Anyway, the Angels' run of dominance is finally over, which is a funny sentence to type.\n\n**21: Detroit Tigers** (7 points) -- The potentially good news with these three words is that you nearly cleared your rack. The bad news is you wasted a lot of useful letters while only managing to match the score of your 6-year-old child's last play. I can't think of a single objective rationale for putting either the Giants or the Angels ahead of the other, so the Angels win because I'm a Dodgers fan; while the Tigers get an edge over both of them because of the scientific fact that tigers are inherently cool.\n\n**Tier Three: Unremarkable Words that are Nevertheless too Complex for my Idiot Sister**\n\n**20: San Diego Padres** (9 points) -- Yes, \"padres\" is a [playable word](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/padres). English is a linguistic melting pot and all that. Congratulations and enjoy your 9 points.\n\n**19: Kansas City Royals** (9 points) -- Royals get the nod over the Padres for the high-value letter, and (to a much lesser extent) because of the Lorde song. \n\n**Tier Four: Emergency Plays for Emergency Situations**\n\n**18: Tampa Bay Rays** (7 points) -- Sometimes you have to deal with an unforgiving board. \"Rays\" offers nearly as many points as the duo above, but in significantly fewer letters, which means this might be a smart strategic play on some boards (although obviously you would usually prefer to save the S). Plus the Y offers potential for double-letter/triple-letter shenanigans. This is what you should have played instead of \"Royals,\" Lorde be damned.\n\n**17: Minnesota Twins** (8 points) -- Eh. The W is nice enough, but why aren't you playing \"wit\" instead? Or \"nit,\" and save the W for a better opportunity? You're playing like my idiot sister. Whom I should stress does not have a developmental disability or anything like that, and is just a regular idiot.\n\n**16: Chicago Cubs** (8 points) -- Solid bang for your buck here, with C and B worth 3 points each. On a bad board with a tray full of vowels, you could do worse. Like \"met.\" Or \"red.\" Or trying to argue for \"astro.\"\n\n**Tier Five: The Braves Tier**\n\n**15: Atlanta Braves** (11 points) -- A borderline play in a vacuum, but juuuust good enough to keep them out of Tier 3. If anyone is curious, the Scrabble dictionary recognizes \"braves,\" but only in the sense of how someone braves danger. \n\n**Tier Six: The Rockies Tier**\n\n**14: Colorado Rockies** (rocky) (14 points) -- \"Rockies\" is [not playable](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/rockies), but \"rocky\" sure is, for a solid 14 points and the best possible score for a team name that does not offer the possibility of landing that sweet 50-point bonus. Speaking of which ...\n\n**Tier Seven: Seven-Letter Names That are Otherwise Pretty Crappy**\n\n**13: Baltimore Orioles** (7 points) -- In a vacuum \"orioles\" is about as crappy of a Scrabble word as it gets, without a single letter worth more than one point. But for this and all subsequent team names, the 50-point bonus for using all seven letters has now become a possibility. This is why S's are so valuable in Scrabble, since you can just lay out \"orioles\" in its entirety right off the end of your idiot sister's play of \"red,\" creating two crappy words plus that 50-point bonus and causing her to flip the board over and go running to Mom to demand that I stop cheating.\n\n**12: Texas Rangers** (8 points) -- Better get that 50 points, because otherwise what a waste of great letters.\n\n**11: Miami Marlins** (9 points)\n\n**10: Pittsburgh Pirates** (9 points) -- Nothing much interesting to say between these two. Pirates are badass sea criminals and marlins are fairly badass giant sport fish. Slight edge to pirates in the cool department, but if you want to argue the reverse I won't squawk.\n\n**9: Los Angeles Dodgers** (10 points) -- There are only 4 D's in the whole tile bag, and you somehow got two of them at the same time. It's unfair! Baseball is ruined!\n\n**8: Milwaukee Brewers** (12 points) -- If I make MLB team rankings for another 100 offseasons, I will never live down the fiasco of Brewer Hicklen. And also I suppose this would be a reasonably respectable Scrabble play.\n\n**Tier Eight: They Will Talk About This Play For Years**\n\n**7: Seattle Mariners** (10 points) -- The Mariners juuuuust squeak into this tier by virtue of requiring one more letter than you could possibly have on your rack, meaning that you'd have to have at least one letter free on the board to accommodate this play. Luckily almost every letter in \"mariners\" shouldn't be too hard to find on the board, although it is amusing to me to imagine someone with \"mariner\" sitting in their rack waiting for an open S to play it on.\n\n**6: Washington Nationals** (9 points) -- Like the Orioles, the Nationals' team name is about as bad as it gets, consisting entirely of 1-point letters. However, it would still make for a rather cool play, since \"nationals\" is a nine-letter word, which means that you'd have to find a 2-letter word such as \"on\" or \"at\" to build it around, and thereby turn a tray of nothing into a pretty sweet turn -- circumstances unique enough that I'm bumping the Nats one place ahead of the Mariners. At least until your opponent pounces on that open S on their next turn. \n\n**5: Cleveland Guardians** (11 points) -- \"Ar\" and \"an\" are both playable words you could build this off of. And boy oh boy it would be fun to lay this down after mom just helped my idiot sister play \"ar.\" \n\n**4: St. Louis Cardinals** (12 points) -- \"Ar,\" \"in,\" \"na,\" and \"al\" are all potential entry points here, but I'm running out of things to say about 2-letter Scrabble words. How about that Masyn Winn, Cards fans? That kid sure looks great. And also what a great Scrabble name. I mean, he's no Jazz Chisholm, but still...\n\n**Tier Nine: Finally Some Wholly Better Plays** **than \"Rocky\"**\n\n**3: The Philadelphia Athletics of Sacramento** (14 points) -- Ummmm, how about that Masyn Winn, A's fans?\n\n**2: Toronto Blue Jays** (bluejays) (20 points) -- \"Bluejay\" is a FANTASTIC Scrabble word, and also perhaps finally Toronto fans won't yap at me for not allowing \"jay\" on its own. Congratulations, Toronto fans, you've finally done it. Looks like you've got this one all wrapped up. No possible event could foreseeably prevent you from winning this--\n\n**Tier Ten: Why'd it Have to be Snakes?**\n\n**1: Arizona Diamondbacks** (24 points) -- There are those other two D's! Maybe baseball isn't broken after all. What makes \"diamondbacks\" such a cool Scrabble play isn't its length or point total (although those certainly help); it's that the only way you could play it would be if either \"diamond\" or \"backs\" was already on the board. A once-in-lifetime circumstance for a fantastic play.",
