In reality, they were going through organizational upheaval and horrible injury luck in Beal/ DJJ along with trying to find proper replacements for Norm Powell's production. Zubac, Bogdanovic, and Collins were all playing incredibly poorly too. Since then, Kobe Sanders and Jordan Miller got more run and are actually improving.\n\nCP3 is an absolute legend but acted like a clown this last time around with the organization.

I'm letting u/WotsTheBestThingUGot down by never getting to my special workaround for Angela Delvecchio. I'm letting u/taffyowner and u/dmlfan928 by never validating their theory about the asterisks (they were dead on). And most of all, I would be letting all of you down by never making the Pablo post.  \nSo here it is.   \n  \nBehold -   \n#¿Cuánto WAR obtiene Pablo Sánchez en una temporada completa de Grandes Ligas? \n  \nI'm not going to go into too much detail about [the things I already covered.](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1op1dal/how_much_war_would_stephanie_morgan_get_in_a_full/)  \n\n1. Backyard Baseball was a PC game I played as a kid. It was an animated sports game with fictional kids you can draft to play for your team. The original came out in 1997. BB 2001 introduced kid versions of Major League players and slightly improved the animation (this was the first version I had). It also changed the player rating system from X/4 for each tool to X/10 (though the underlying attributes were the same). BB 2003 was virtually identical to 2001, aside from updating the Major League players for each team (instead of Mark McGwire as the Cardinals representative, the 2003 version had Ablert Pujols.  \n  \n2. A couple years ago, I learned there was [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1waTChkjtCecz_3_dtEMTqnf_r8276NjB_zrzK-n7O6g/edit?usp=sharing) that had all the underlying attributes (eg. Contact, Power, Arm, Eye, and all on a 1-100 scale) for each player. I thought it would be a great idea to convert each of those attributes into real life MLB stats and put it all together into one WAR total for each player.  \n  \n3. WAR is made up of six parts - Batting, fielding, runnning, positional adjustment, league adjustment, and replacement level. We won't be dealing with league adjustment because we're putting the players on a neutral team. The total of those numbers are a player's Runs Above Replacement, which is then converted to Wins Above Replacement. To read me go into more detail about this, here's an analysis of [How much (negative) WAR I would get playing in the Majors for a season.](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/jzggdq/how_much_negative_war_would_i_accrue_playing_on_a/0)\n    \n4. Since the player attributes are scaled from 1-100, I figured the best thing to do is match those values to the same numbers on Baseball Savant's [Percentile Rankings Leaderboard](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/leaderboard/percentile-rankings?type=batter&team=) and go from there.  \n  \n5. For batting I decided to go with a reconstruction of wOBA using xBA, xISO, and BB%. So I'd take the player's Contact rating, match it to that percentile of xBA, do the same for Power and Eye, and reconstruct the player's wOBA based on those.    \n  \n#Batting  \nThis seems like a good place to introduce Pablo's numbers. Contrary to popular belief, Pablo [~~actually does speak English~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtBUJ_P5hmg) is not infallible. His Power is a perfect 100, but his Contact is a mortal 63, and his Eye is only a 68. Too late into my process, I realized Eye is not actually taken into account in the game's X/4 or X/10 Batting rating, but if we were to put these players in the Majors, it would be a very relevant factor to their total WAR. His 63 Contact rating matches the 63 xBA rank of Ian Happ, Colt Keith, Andrew McCutchen, and Andy Pages. Blasphemy, I know. Those guys had either a .266 or .267 xBA, so let's call it .2665. His 100 Power would be somewhere between Judge's .420 xISO and Ohtani's .384, so we'll go with .402. As for Eye, the high end of that scale was really skewing the results and giving players like Vicki Kawaguchi GOATed numbers, so I had to flatten that out by turning it into a linear correlation, making Pablo's 68 Eye into a .1035 BB%.  \n  \nWe currently know 10.35% of his Plate Appearances would result in a Walk. And 26.65% of his At Bats would result in a Hit, but how many Hits per Plate Appearance? We'll ignore other types of outcomes like Sac Flys and HBPs, and simply subtract the 10.35% of Plate Appearances that are Walks. So if 89.65% of Plate Appearances are either Hits or Outs (also known as At Bats), and 26.65% of those are Hits, then 0.2665x0.8965=0.238917 - 23.9% of all Plate Appearances are Hits. His statline is coming together. .267 AVG, .342 OBP (BB%+Hits per PA), and .669 SLG (xBA+xISO).  \n  \nBut we want to turn this into wOBA. The run value of a Walk is .691, and he'd walk 10.35% of every PA, so he'd earn .071519 Runs per PA on Walks. We can do a similar calculus with Hits. Assuming for now every Hit is a Single (we'll upgrade the Extra Base Hits later), 23.9% of PAs at .882 runs comes out to a minimum of .210725 Runs per PA on Hits. ISO tells us the total bases of the Extra Base Hits, but doesn't tell us how they're distributed. Which is a problem because wOBA weights each type of XBH differently, and not on a simple scale like SLG and ISO.  \n  \nThere were 14,023 Extra Base Hits hit in 2025. 7745 of them (55.2% of the total) were Doubles. 628 (4.5%) were Triples. 5650 (40.3%) were Homers. Which makes the average extra bases per XBH 1.85. Let's now plug in run values for Doubles (1.252), Triples (1.584), and Homers (2.037). But since we already counted each hit as a single, we only need the value above a single, similar to how ISO is only the SLG rate above a single: 2B = .370, 3B = .702, HR = 1.155. And we're going to assume regular distribution of XBH so -   \n2B    .370 x .552=.204  \n3B    .702 x .045=.031  \nHR    1.155 x .403=.465  \n.204+.031+.403=.700  \nEach Extra Base Hit is worth, on average, 70% of a run more than a single. Divide this by the 1.85 from earlier (I still can't wrap my head around why this made intuitive sense to me to do when I calculated it, but it works so just trust me bro) to get .379 and we can now convert a player's ISO into wOBA values for Extra Base Hits by multiplying it by .379. Before we can do that, we need to turn the xISO into xISO by Plate Appearance, so we multiply his .402 xISO by the 89.65% from earlier to end up with .360 Plate Appearance ISO. We now can multiply that .360 PAISO by the .379 extra run value per Extra Base Hit, giving us .137 extra run value from XBH per PA.   \n  \nNow all we need to do is add those values together. .072 for Walks, .211 for Hits, and .137 for Extra Base Hits. The result is an estimated .419 wOBA for Pablo Sanchez.  \n  \nwOBA is basically Runs per PA (it's actually not that at all), but to find total runs we have to know how many PAs Pablo would get. Assuming he played a full season, this would depend on where in the batting order Pablo would hit. Here's how those PA are broken down:  \n  \n\n\nLineup Spot | Total | Per Team\n---|---|----\n1 | 22401 | 746.7\n2 | 21869 | 728.9667\n3 | 21387 | 712.9\n4 | 20905 | 696.8333\n5 | 20391 | 679.7\n6 | 19855 | 661.8333\n7 | 19296 | 643.2\n8 | 18687 | 622.9\n9 | 18135 | 604.5  \n  \nNowadays, Pablo would be an obvious \\#2 hitter. And I originally had him in that spot. But the spreadsheet had other ideas. It turns out there's a protocol to where the game AI puts players in the lineup. The first thing it looks for is best bat (I assume this means Contact) and Speed combo, and puts that player in the third spot. Next, it looks for the player with the most Power and slots them in at cleanup. The next best bat and Speed goes to the 2 hole. Then the 5 hole. And the fastest of the remaining players leads off. Then the last four spots get filled out in descending order of...something. The spreadsheed says \"leftover in file order\", idk.  \n  \nYou might want to award Pablo with one of the top Bat/Speed combos, but when I actually rank players by one part Contact, 3/4 parts speed (why did I do it like that? Who can say at this point? I did this back in October), the best candidates for the 3 spot were Annie Frazier, Luanne Lui, and Billy Jean Blackwood. But there is no doubting Pablo's power, earning him the cleanup spot and 697 PAs.  \n  \n((.419^^wOBA -.313^^lg ^^wOBA )/1.232^^wOBA ^^scale )x697^^PA = **59.8 wRAA**  \n  \n#Replacement Level    \nOnce we know his number of Plate Appearances, Replacement Level is easy. We'll do 570x(9.774^^runs ^^per ^^win /182925^^lgPA )x697 = **21.2 Runs.**  \n    \n#Baserunning  \nBaserunning is pretty straightforward. I lined up the Major League sprint speed percentiles with those players' Baserunning Run Values, and saw there was a decent correlation. So I got the linear correlation from Excel, and tweaked it a bit so that the high end gets extra rewarded for being stupid fast. Pablo's 81 Speed correlates to 1.6 Baserunning Runs. **1.6 Runs.**  \n  \n#Fielding  \nHere's where things get really wild. The spreadsheet says Fielding rating is made up of four attributes - Vision (also known as Eye in some versions of the spreadseet), Throwing Strength, Throwing Accuracy, and Glove/Reaction (also known as Coordination in some versions of the spreadsheet). Weirdly, range is not considered. Maybe Glove/Reaction/Coordination is range? Idk. Luckily, Baseball Savant's Fielding Runs are also made up of two(ish) components. There's Range Runs, which is based on Outs Above Average, and there are Arm Runs. There's also DP Runs, but those aren't really predctive from year to year, so they're mostly noise. I may have just made that up, but I'm not gonna go back and check.  \nI'm going to use a combination of Vision/Eye and Glove/Reaction/Coordination as a proxy for Range. And I'll use a combination of Throwing Strength and Throwing Accuracy for Arm. But at what ratios? The way I did it is wrong, this much is clear. But it worked out, so I guess that's good. I lined up each of the Backyard kids' ratings Throwing Strength against their final X/10 rating for Fielding, and got the R^^2 correlation. I did the same for Accuracy, Glove, and Vision. The sum of the results was pretty close to 1, so I took that as a sign that something worked. I multiplied each player's rating by that correlation number (scaled up a bit so the total of all four is 1) and compared that result to the player's X/10 Fielding rating. It was close enough! The secret formula is 74.9% Glove, 1.7% Eye, 20.65% Accuracy, and 2.75% Arm Strength. Now we split them into Arm and Range. Of the \"range\" tools, Glove makes up 97.8%, and Vision makes up 2.2%. 97.8% of Pablo's 100 Glove is 97.8. 2.2% of Pablo's 68 Eye/Vision is 1.5. Pablo's Range percentile is 99.3. We'll round that to 99.  \nOf the throwing tools, Accuracy makes up 88.3%, and Strength makes up 11.7%. 88.3% of Pablo's 78 Accuracy is 68.9. 11.7% of his 72 Throwing Strength is 8.4. Pablo's Arm percentile is 77.3. Good to know.   \n  \nRange Runs are not on the Statcast Percentile Rankings Leaderboard, but Outs Above Average is. Range Runs are calculated by multiplying OAA by .75 for infielders or by .9 for outfielders. I once again lined up the MLB players by OAA Percentile and total OAA (which I calculated by reverse engineering OAA, started from Range Runs and multiplied by 1.3333 or 1.11111. This is because the Fielding Run Value Leaderboard gets granular when you export the CSV and also there seem to be some slight weird errors on the OAA page. Like why would PCA, who according to the OAA page is tied for the league lead with 24, have a 99th OAA Percentile? (Oh wait, it looks like they fixed that. He's now 100, but his numbers are the same on the Fielding Run Value Leaderboard. I don't know what to believe anymore)) Where was I? Oh yes, we line up the values, and match them. 99th percentile is OAA is about 19 on average. Pablo will be playing Shortstop (we'll get there), so his Range Runs are 14.25.  \n  \nArm Runs aren't on the Statcast Percentile Rankings Leaderboard, either. I just lined up every MLB infielder and put the most Arm Runs at 100 and the worst at 1 and filled in the rest. I did the same for outfielders. I realize this isn't how you do percentiles, but you've already gotten this far for some godforsaken reason, you're not going to stop now. I did separate lists for infielders and outfielders because while the most Arm Runs an infielder got was Matt Mclain with 0.8, Steven Kwan topped the outfielders list with 6.76. Pablo's 77 becomes .24. Add his Range Runs and Arm Runs together and you get **14.5 Runs.**  \n  \n#Positional Adjustment    \nPablo is a SS. I'm writing this at 3 AM, I'm not going to elaborate.   \nUpdate: I woke up. I realized there's more to say. I'm going to elaborate.  \nSimilar to lineup spots, the game also has a system for placing players at defensive positions. But given that it's a stupid-ass system, I have elected to ignore it. The first postion they fill is Pitcher, based on Pitching ratings. That works. Next is 1B, based on a combination of Glove and Height. Setting aside the fact that I only just found the Height ratings moments ago, this doesn't really work for me. First base is the position where we should be *least* concerned with their glove, not most. I realize in the context of the game where errors are common you want a sure-handed first baseman, but it just doesn't work like that in the Majors. The next position filled by the game is SS, but only takes Throwing Strength and Throwing Accuracy into account. That's wild. So I did my own positional assignments. I started by identifying the lefties. Maria Luna, Annie Frazier, Marky Dubois, Pete Wheeler, Mikey Thomas, Gretchen Hasselhoff, and Dante Robinson would have to play either first base or in the outfield. Maria was going to be in Left for obvious reasons (iykyk). It would be a miscarriage of justice if I put Pete anywhere but CF. One by one, I chose positions for each player. I put the best \"range\" fielders at short (Vicki, Pablo, Ernie). The next best in Center and at Second. The best arms in Right and at Third. And the poorest fielders in Left and at First. The one exception to this was Angela Delvecchio. Doing this exercise, it became clear to me that Angela is supposed to pitch. She's the the only non-professional with a 10/10 rating in Pitching, and the only one with a fielding rating below 2 (hers is 1). I didn't think it was fair to dock her WAR just because I wasn't doing pitching WAR (yet...), so I made the executive decision to consider her a DH, which comes with a -17.5 Positional Adjustment, but no negative Fielding runs.  **7.5 Runs.**  \n  \n\n\nCategory | Runs\n---|---\nBatting | 59.8\nFielding | 14.5\nBaserunning | 1.6\nPosition | 7.5\nReplacement | 21.2\nTotal | 104.7  \n  \nAfter dividing by the 9.774 R/W metric, Pablo will net **10.7 WAR.**  \n  \nFor those keeping track, here's a handy chart of the WARs of various characters I've calculated:  \n  \n\n\nSubject | WAR | Notes\n---|---|----\n[Me](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/jzggdq/how_much_negative_war_would_i_accrue_playing_on_a/) | -15 | It's only gotten worse over time.\n[Magic Potato](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/kfl97b/how_much_negative_war_would_a_potato_accrue/) | -45 | This potato is magic because the team doesn't realize they're fielding a potato in centerfield until it's too late.
