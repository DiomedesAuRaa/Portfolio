TMZ Sports has learned that the person behind the mask has lawyered up -- and has selected the attorney that represented Sofia Jamora in her domestic violence lawsuit against Hayes.\n\nWaukeenMcCoy told us that he is now representing the person Hayes decked when the Lakers were in town for a showdown with Washington on January 30.\n\n\"We will give them the opportunity to resolve the matter before taking legal action,\" McCoy said. \"But legal action is anticipated.\"\n\nHe also said other parties could be involved.\n\nWhen asked about any injuries the person sustained ... McCoy said, \"All I want to say at the moment is that he was injured.\"\n\nAs you know, Hayes was suspended for one game by the NBA after the incident. He served that suspension during the Lakers' game against the Philadelphia 76ers last week at Crypto.com Arena.",

We blame the refs but that wasn't the issue - should have never lost that game but the two turnovers killed us. \n\nMatt choked and that was our BEST team in this century. We had the second best defense in the NFL that year. They were best in the league in rush defense, second in YPG and third in points allowed. \n\nWe added Tate, Prater, drafted Van Noy, Ebron and had prime Calvin and a REALLY GOOD Reggie Bush. The offensive line performance that year was also the third best in pass blocking at thirteenth in run blocking. \n\nWe had a complete, total team. \n\nIf we beat Dallas (which we 1000% should have), we go into Lambeau and win (we split with them and lost the last game of the year there because of just some dumb play by Matt) and honestly the way that NFCCG went down, I think we could have won that also. Hell, if we beat Green Bay in Week 17, we get the bye and beat Dallas at home to go to the NFCCG anyway. \n\nI would give anything for us to have that type of defensive performance by a defense again, especially with this team.
