Not to mention a bunch of the supporting characters (who are there specifically TO be spent as stakes-raising capital). hell, this pic is missing Will, Joyce, Dustin, Steve, Jonathan, Holly, and Nancy, too!\n\nShow just completely disappeared up its own ass starting in Season 3, and lost all control of what it was trying to be. It became a clumsy (and overly precious, on top of that) pastiche of Marvel/Superhero storytelling in cheap 80s drag, and not any kind of King/Spielberg/Carpenter homage anymore.\n\nThe most 80s thing about it is that it got dumber, worse, and more expensive as it kept going, and then went long past the point of it ever hoping to be good again. Like it started as a prestige tribute to Amblin/Universal suburban fantasy - and now it's basically a Golan/Globus - Cannon Films co-production, only with Marvel Money behind it (instead of getting its budget slashed last second.)\n\nThat sucks.",
