No big media outlets (cable, print etc) have touched this story. None of the many basketball podcasts I listen to daily (except for a lame “we don’t have the legal understanding to discuss this but recommend you check out pablo’s story” from the athletic’s nba daily).\n\nI get why the aspiration story blew up, and how it directly affects the league and cap circumvention etc. but for this to get no mainstream coverage is wild to me. What am I missing?\n\nAnd btw I’m not asking for some corporate social justice slop from the league. But this is serious and for them to not even acknowledge a report alleging that an owner is defying international law/sanctions is mind boggling to me\n\nEDIT: here is a link to Hunterbrook’s investigation/the allegations I reference above:  [https://hntrbrk.com/ubiquiti/](https://hntrbrk.com/ubiquiti/)",

We have not yet seen his address to the world, but we take these matters very seriously, and we will investigate.” \n\nWhen it comes to the head office, the league are basically lawyers protecting the business interests of _all_ the owners. So not until it becomes embarrassing to other owners will they say anything. \n\nA couple of owners may have no problem with what Pera’s ~~drone~~ company is doing all with the equipment that’s ending up in Russia. \n\nI’ll admit that I didn’t watch the Pablo videos on Pera, but just have the general jist of it. \n\nThough I bet he seems know federal inquiry about violating sanctions against Russia, I bet he gets a call from the White House (and maybe even the Mavericks owners) about violating sanctions against Iran.",

We have good RB depth, but Beck likes to rotate RB's more than any other OC we have had. Moa has the ability to play more positions than the other two, and like Hiter it's an early enrollee. With that being said Moa and Hiter obviously have much better chance to be the most impactful out of those three. I personally think that Moa might have a slight edge due to the amount of positions he can play. I guess we will see!",

I’m sure that’s the mindset, but tackling is about getting all the way there, wrapping the guy—thudding the guy, wrapping him—and then you just don’t got to do the extra bring him to the ground, right? Half the time, guys are just in desperation trying to get somebody on the ground where you’re putting yourself and the person who you’re tackling at risk, right? That’s improper tackling technique, but if you’re doing it correctly, you can be in a position where you can tackle and be like, ‘Okay, I ain’t bringing you all the way to the ground.’”",
