        "selftext": "I recently made a post about which teams had the best home field advantage (HFA). [That post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1pki092/home_field_advantage_improved_methodology_w_fpi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) was a measure of which teams gain the most points when playing at home. So I took a different approach to measuring this. Now I want to look at a simpler question: How hard is it to win at a given stadium. This approach will inevitably be *heavily influenced* by how good a team has been over the time frame, but still helps us answer the question.\n\nLet me be very clear: this list is NOT a ranking of which teams should have the largest \"home field advantage\" value applied when handicapping games. Those values can be found in the previous post. This is a list of the hardest places to play, period.\n\n**Methodology:** Looking at all FBS games played in the past 20 seasons, I calculated the \"expected performance\" of all opponents at a given stadium based on their performance in other road games. Then I calculated how many points better or worse teams did at a given stadium than the same teams did in their other road games. Only teams with at least 50 home games during that timeframe are included.\n\nThe correlation of this data with home win % is 0.49 and the correlation with average home margin is 0.47\n\n|Rank|TeamName|Stadium Name|Points Above Average|Conference|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Alabama|Bryant-Denny Stadium|9.6|SEC|\n|2|Ohio State|Ohio Stadium|9.0|Big Ten|\n|3|Oklahoma|Memorial Stadium (Norman, OK)|8.7|SEC|\n|4|Oregon|Autzen Stadium|8.5|Big Ten|\n|5|LSU|Tiger Stadium (LA)|7.7|SEC|\n|6|Georgia|Sanford Stadium|7.7|SEC|\n|7|Clemson|Memorial Stadium (Clemson, SC)|7.6|ACC|\n|8|USC|Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|7.1|Big Ten|\n|9|Michigan|Michigan Stadium|6.7|Big Ten|\n|10|Penn State|Beaver Stadium|6.6|Big Ten|\n|11|Notre Dame|Notre Dame Stadium|6.5|Independent|\n|12|Wisconsin|Camp Randall Stadium|6.2|Big Ten|\n|13|Florida|Ben Hill Griffin Stadium|5.8|SEC|\n|14|Washington|Husky Stadium|5.7|Big Ten|\n|15|Utah|Rice-Eccles Stadium|5.7|Big 12|\n|16|Texas|DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium|5.6|SEC|\n|17|Boise State|Albertsons Stadium|5.6|MWC|\n|18|Oklahoma State|Boone Pickens Stadium|5.6|Big 12|\n|19|Kansas State|Bill Snyder Family Stadium|5.4|Big 12|\n|20|TCU|Amon G.

Instead, it has four tiers:\n\nBasic Tier: lowest salary, based mostly on positional averages.\n\nPlaytime Tier: higher than basic, based on playing time thresholds.\n\nOne Pro Bowl Tier: earns a salary equal to the transition tag at his position.\n\nMultiple Pro Bowls Tier: earns a salary equal to the franchise tag at his position. \n\nFWIW, alternate Pro Bowl selections do not count towards this.

        "selftext": "Merry Christmas ya filthy football fans!\n\nAs has been tradition for several years in r/soccer, the Mod Team will take a break on the 25th December, the birthday of our lord and saviour (Chris Kamara).\n\nThis means the subreddit will be locked for new submissions, for 24 hours.\n\nr/soccer will be closed to submissions from **midnight GMT on the 25th December, to midnight GMT on the 26th December** \\- adopting the UK timezone (as the world revolves around the Premier League).\n\nFear not, however - we have set up a variety of discussion threads for r/soccer to enjoy on this day of kindness, generosity, and sharing. These will be posted throughout the day, and links to those threads can be found in the body of this post, which will be updated throughout the day.\n\nWe will also repeat the new tradition (as of last year) of enabling gifs and images in comments - for more festive frivolity.\n\n# For clarity: there was an infamous year when we \"relaxed the rules\" for Christmas Day. Due to a shit avalanche of racism, homophobia and sexism, we will never be doing that again. Rules still apply, you've been warned.\n\nFrom the whole mod team at r/soccer, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, however and wherever you may be celebrating!\n\n# Discussion threads:\n\n* [Christmas Eve's \"All I Want For Christmas Is...\" Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1pult85/the_all_i_want_for_christmas_is_thread/)\n* [Festive Free Talk ~~Friday~~ Thread Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1pv0q3c/festive_free_talk_thread_part_1/)\n* [Festive \"Sunday\" Support](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1pva7zk/festive_sunday_support/)\n* [The \"Not Quite Football\" Chat Room (for games, books, films)](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1pvbz8t/the_not_quite_football_chat_room_for_games_books/)\n* [The Post Christmas Dinner Rating Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1pve0rz/the_post_christmas_dinner_rating_thread/?sort=new)\n* [Festive Free Talk ~~Friday~~ Thread Part 2 (After Dark)](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1pvk7ug/festive_free_talk_thread_part_2_after_dark/)\n\nThe current Daily Discussion Thread can also be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1puygcn/daily_discussion/)\n\nAnd finally... \n\n# [The 2025 Christmas Quiz! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1pts2cj/the_2025_rsoccer_christmas_quiz/)- from u/AnnieIWillKnow (as is tradition)",
