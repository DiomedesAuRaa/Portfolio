        "selftext": "\nThese days, Ben Simmons wakes up with a newfound appreciation for simply being able to stand up straight.\n\nIt has been years since the 29-year-old former No. 1 overall NBA Draft pick and three-time All-Star has played at a level commensurate with his early accolades, and there’s no shortage of explanations for the downward trend in Simmons’ career. Is his poor outside shooting the root of all the problems? Did he somehow lose his confidence? Could it all be fixed by shooting with his right hand?\n\nThose theories are all debatable, but according to Simmons persistent back injuries halted his development. In an interview with The Athletic, Simmons described his ailing back as “one of those things where you’re dealing with it every day, sitting down, going to sleep, flying on planes.”\n\n“People don’t understand that,” he said.\n\nOver his nine years in the league, Simmons has missed 273 games. Over the last four seasons, he’s been available to play in just one-third of his teams’ games. In 2024-25, he played 51 total games for the Brooklyn Nets and LA Clippers, averaging 5 points and 22 minutes per game. Throughout the year, Simmons said he often felt only “20 or 30 percent” healthy. At times, he said he could barely stand up straight on the mornings before games.\n\nTired of playing hurt, Simmons said he decided against signing with another NBA team in the offseason, opting instead for an extended rehab effort meant to restore his health in time to return to the league either later this season or before the 2026-27 campaign.\n\n“I’m about to be 30 years old, and I need to make the best decision for Ben Simmons,” he said. “It’s not fun going out there, not being able to move, not be able to jump, or, you know, take hits. There’s no fun in that. Sometimes you got to make a decision with how you feel and what’s best for yourself. And that’s what I’ve done, and it’s not for everybody to really understand, because they’re not in my shoes.”\n\nBefore he attempts another comeback, Simmons said he is training in Los Angeles with the goal of becoming “bulletproof” to avoid further setbacks. He also said his shot finally feels good and that he can now take a simple hook shot without any discomfort.\n\n\nSource: https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6923182/2025/12/29/ben-simmons-nba-return-fishing-team/\n\n",

        "selftext": "We all talk about how Nikola Jokic gets his teammates PAID. And how some of them move on to brick playing for other teams (shoutout KCP). Now as a Deni Avdija stan the amount of assists his teammates are fumbling got me to flip the question: which of the top playmakers are creating tons of opportunities that their teammates are bricking?\n\nIf you're a shooter looking to secure the bag, who should you try to play with?\n\nDisclaimer - I'm not a stats wizard, and used some AI to crunch these numbers. The formulas used here are pretty basic and don't factor in advanced stuff like weights, shot difficulty, etc.\n\n# Some glossary first\n\n|Stat|Definition|\n|:-|:-|\n|**PA** (Potential Assists)|Any pass to a teammate who shoots within 1 dribble of receiving the ball|\n|**ACR%** (Assist Conversion Rate)|Percentage of PA actually converted|\n|**Wasted**|Number of PA that didn't go in|\n|**exWasted**|Expected Wasted at league average ACR%|\n|**SMH** (Shots Missed by Homies)|Wasted minus exWasted - essentially how many more/less AST you would've had at league avg|\n|**BAG** (literally bag)|Where to get your bag. Average rank of PA/Wasted/SMH|\n\n# The BAG Rank\n\n**BAG** tells you who shooters should want to play with if they want to get paid.\n\nIt's the average of three rankings:\n\n1. **PA Rank** \\- who creates the most opportunities\n2. **Wasted Rank** \\- who has the most wasted opportunities\n3. **SMH Rank** \\- who has the most AST to gain from better shooters\n\nShowing better opportunity for a shooter to come in and feast.\n\nExample:\n\n* **Josh Giddey**: #3 in the league in PA and Wasted shots, but his teammates shoot slightly above average. BAG = 7.3 for solid #5.\n* **Nikola Jokic**: Creates tons of opportunities too, but his teammates already convert at elite rates. so while having almost the lowest SMH, the sheer amount of opportunities created and wasted still give him a #8 **BAG** of 10.7\n\n# The Results\n\nFiltered by minimum 15 games, 10 potential assists per game - resulting in top 27 PA dishers. League avg ACR% = 54.7%. Table is sorted by BAG\n\n|Rank|Player|Team|AST|PA|Wasted|exWasted|ACR%|SMH|BAG|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Deni Avdija|POR|6.6|14.2|7.6|6.4|46.5%|\\+1.2|2.7|\n|2|Cade Cunningham|DET|9.7|18.4|8.7|8.3|52.7%|\\+0.4|3.0|\n|3|Shai Gilgeous-Alexander|OKC|6.5|13.3|6.8|6.0|48.9%|\\+0.8|5.3|\n|4|Devin Booker|PHX|6.5|13.2|6.7|6.0|49.2%|\\+0.7|6.7|\n|5|Josh Giddey|CHI|9.2|16.4|7.2|7.4|56.1%|\\-0.2|7.3|\n|6|Jalen Johnson|ATL|8.4|14.8|6.4|6.7|56.8%|\\-0.3|9.3|\n|7|Jamal Murray|DEN|6.8|13.0|6.2|5.9|52.3%|\\+0.3|9.7|\n|8|Nikola Jokić|DEN|11.1|18.1|7.0|8.2|61.3%|\\-1.2|10.7|\n|9|Andrew Nembhard|IND|6.9|13.0|6.1|5.9|53.1%|\\+0.2|10.7|\n|10|Isaiah Collier|UTA|6.3|12.3|6.0|5.6|51.2%|\\+0.4|11.3|\n|11|Darius Garland|CLE|6.7|12.7|6.0|5.8|52.8%|\\+0.2|12.0|\n|12|Jalen Brunson|NYK|6.4|12.3|5.9|5.6|52.0%|\\+0.3|12.7|\n|13|Tyrese Maxey|PHI|7.0|12.9|5.9|5.8|54.3%|\\+0.1|13.0|\n|14|Donovan Mitchell|CLE|5.4|11.2|5.8|5.1|48.2%|\\+0.7|14.0|\n|15|Jimmy Butler III|GSW|4.9|10.8|5.9|4.9|45.4%|\\+1.0|14.0|\n|16|Keyonte George|UTA|6.8|12.5|5.7|5.7|54.4%|\\+0.0|15.3|\n|17|James Harden|LAC|8.0|13.4|5.4|6.1|59.7%|\\-0.7|15.7|\n|18|Luka Dončić|LAL|8.7|14.0|5.3|6.3|62.1%|\\-1.0|16.3|\n|19|Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|5.8|11.1|5.3|5.0|52.3%|\\+0.3|18.0|\n|20|De'Aaron Fox|SAS|6.1|11.3|5.2|5.1|54.0%|\\+0.1|18.3|\n|21|Davion Mitchell|MIA|7.2|12.3|5.1|5.6|58.5%|\\-0.5|19.3|\n|22|Stephon Castle|SAS|7.0|12.1|5.1|5.5|57.9%|\\-0.4|20.3|\n|23|LaMelo Ball|CHA|8.5|13.0|4.5|5.9|65.4%|\\-1.4|21.0|\n|24|Immanuel Quickley|TOR|6.4|11.1|4.7|5.0|57.7%|\\-0.3|22.0|\n|25|Russell Westbrook|SAC|7.2|11.9|4.7|5.4|60.5%|\\-0.7|22.3|\n|26|Alperen Sengun|HOU|6.8|11.4|4.6|5.2|59.6%|\\-0.6|22.7|\n|27|Ryan Rollins|MIL|5.8|10.0|4.2|4.5|58.0%|\\-0.3|24.3|\n\nAs you can see, the data confirms my suspicions - **Deni**'s teammates are converting at a **disgusting 46.5% rate** which is 2nd worst in the league behind Jimmy and **8.2%** below league average. Having **14.2 PA** (#5 in the league) and **+1.2 SMH** (#1) makes him the top destination for bag chasers at **2.7 BAG**.\n\nRight below him is **Cade** with **3.0 BAG** \\- League leader in both potential and wasted assists, with teammates shooting below average. Malik Beasley punching air rn.\n\nSurprisingly **SGA** is ranked #3 with **5.3** **BAG**. is OKC more dependent on him than previously thought? i guess so based on the past 2 weeks.\n\nThe only team with 2 top 10 BAGers is **Denver** with **Murray** and **Jokic** at #7 and #8, still might be the top tier bag destination. Other teams with 2 players in the list: CLE (#11, #14), UTA (#10, #16), MIL (#19, #27), SAS (#20, #22)\n\n**Who's teammates are already eating:**\n\nnegative SMH means teammates are missing less than expected, essentially giving you more AST than usual.\n\n* **LaMelo Ball (lowest SMH at -1.4)** \\- his CHA teammates convert way above average (65.4% ACR), the Kon effect?\n* **Jokic and Luka at #2 and #3**\n* **Westbrook at #4!**\n\n  \nSources: [https://www.nba.com/stats/players/passing?CF=GP\\*G\\*15:POTENTIAL\\_AST\\*G\\*10&dir=D&sort=POTENTIAL\\_AST](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/passing?CF=GP*G*15:POTENTIAL_AST*G*10&dir=D&sort=POTENTIAL_AST)",

        "selftext": "Hello and happy holidays to everyone on r/baseball. I hope you and your loved ones all had a wholesome and very merry Christmas. Now let's talk about freaky sex.\n\nThis is a ranking of how likely it is that a team name might be spoken, shouted, moaned, whispered, or otherwise vocalized during a sexual interaction. For the purposes of this list, \"sex\" includes everything that might possibly fall under a very broad umbrella of sexual interactions which I am not going to attempt to circumscribe or define here, EXCEPT to note that post-coital intimacy is explicitly not included -- otherwise, statements such as \"do you think the Brewers game is still on?\" would be in play.\n\nFor the purposes of these rankings, I am using the team's official name in its entirety as stated on [mlb.com](http://mlb.com/), and no short versions or nicknames. This means we are only considering the Blue Jays and not the \"Jays\" or (so help me) \"BJs.\" And before Toronto fans complain too much, please understand that otherwise the A's and O's would absolutely run away with this one.\n\nHowever, I am allowing both the singular (\"f\\*\\*k me like a Brewer!\") and the plural (\"this is even better than when that group of Brewers f\\*\\*ked me last night!\"). And since we are only considering the spoken word I am allowing homophones as well, which should come as a delight to the small-but-vocal segment of Philadelphia fans who are weirdly insistent that their team is named after young female horses.\n\nRelatedly, I am allowing situations where the team name is said as part of a larger word or phrase. Which is potentially important news for anyone who spontaneously sings \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" at the moment of climax, but probably more important for teams such as the Astros and Reds.\n\nAs always, these rankings are just for fun, and in no way reflect my feelings vis-a-vis these teams, their players, their ownership, or their fans. Nor do these rankings necessarily reflect my sexual interests, proclivities, or experiences as a cisgendered heterosexual man. If you feel I am overlooking a situation feel free to note it in the comments, but for the love of God please do NOT share your personal sexual anecdotes here. This is not r/Economics.\n\nSince a disappointing number of you never bothers to read these rules anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and wrap up the foreplay and get on with the action.\n\n**Tier One -- Perhaps As a Safety Word**\n\n**30: Arizona Diamondbacks**\n\n**29: Washington Nationals**\n\n**28: Toronto Blue Jays**\n\n**27: Baltimore Orioles** \\-- The ranking of these four is more or less arbitrary, but for what it's worth I think \"Oriole\" would make a great safety word. And for a variety of reasons which I will not describe in detail, it is better if a safety word is not too long and does not include any sounds such as \"b\" or \"t\" which might require you to be able to close your mouth or bring your teeth together.\n\n**Tier Two --** ***Les Adjectifs de L'Amour***\n\n**26: Los Angeles Dodgers** \\-- Look, this is a judgment-free zone. Sometimes discretion is the better part of valor.\n\n**25: Atlanta Braves** \\-- \"It was so brave of you not to say 'oriole' when I \\[\\*\\*\\*\\*\\] that \\[\\*\\*\\*\\*\\] in your \\[\\*\\*\\*\\*\\].\"\n\n**24:** (I'm still calling them the Oakland) **Athletics** \\-- Several possibilities here, including commentary on how athletic one might be in dodging that object or substance.\n\n**Tier Three -- There's No Wrong Way to Roleplay, But ...**\n\n**23: Milwaukee Brewers** \\-- Presuming that you are not having sex with Brewer Hicklen.\n\n**22: Texas Rangers** \\-- Cowboys/cowgirls/cow-nonbinaries are a fairly common fantasy. Maybe people fantasize about rangers as well, but it seems rather less likely to me.\n\n**21: Seattle Mariners** \\-- I won't argue much if you think the Rangers and Mariners should switch spots. But just think of the possibilities if MLB had had the good sense to name the team the \"Seattle Sailors\" instead.\n\n**20: Cleveland Guardians** \\-- Numbers 21-23 represent unusual but otherwise fine forms of roleplay. This one represents a much different form of problematic roleplay. And that's all we need to say about that.\n\n**Tier Four -- Where Should I Insert This** (Giggity)\n\n**19: Kansas City Royals** \\-- The Royals juuuuuust fall out of the weird-roleplay group. If they were named the Kings, fuhgettaboutit, right up to the front of the line. But does anyone call anyone else \"royal\" during sex? \"Oh baby, you do that so royally\" -- just doesn't sound right. But \"royal\" just happens to have a vowel combination that sounds like something someone might moan. (Go ahead, give it a try, just double-check that no one's within earshot first). So between that and however likely it might be that someone might like to be called Royal Something-or-other during sex, I'm putting it here.\n\n**18: New York Mets** \\-- No one is likely to say \"met\" as such during sex; but consider all the other things they might say: \"Oh my God, I'm so glad I met you in this Denny's restroom!\" \"No, not the furry ones, the metal ones!\" So on and so forth.\n\n**Tier Five -- The Sexual Dynamics of Hosiery**\n\n**17: Boston Red Sox** \\-- \"Oh yeah, Tina, you look so hot in those red socks.\"\n\n**16: Chicago White Sox** \\-- \"For God's sake, Allen, I'm not doing this if you don't at least take off those white socks.\"\n\n**Tier Six -- Sexy Nicknames**\n\n**15: Chicago Cubs** \\-- I'm just going to assume that there is a subset of the gay community for which this term is applied. Or failing that, perhaps someone with a speech impediment might say \"I'm gonna cub!\" \n\n**14: New York Yankees** \\-- Without delving unnecessarily into personal anecdotes, I will just say from personal experience that if you happen to be from anywhere geographically or culturally north of the Mason-Dixon Line and you share an intimate moment with someone from the other side of said line, there's a decent chance that you will hear this. Most likely being shouted at you, with a few vulgarities sprinkled in.\n\n**13: Philadelphia Phillies** \\-- A good one to come back with right after she calls you a damn dirty Yankee.\n\n**12: Detroit Tigers** \\-- Now we're drawing blood.\n\n**Tier Seven -- Roleplaying of the Less Esoteric and/or Horrifying Kind**\n\n**11: Pittsburgh Pirates** \\-- Yar, here comes me plank to shiver yer timbers and take that booty! Those of you who enjoy a jolly roger know who you are.\n\n**10: St. Louis Cardinals**\n\n**9: San Diego Padres** \\-- Religion is a common fetish, and nuns and priests are very commonly sexualized and feature in the fantasies of many a current or former Catholic. \"Padre\" seems rather more likely than \"cardinal,\" but the latter cannot be entirely ruled out. And no, I'm not going to consider any other possible sexual situations for either of these team names.\n\n**Tier Eight -- Regular-Ass People's Names**\n\n**8: Miami Marlins**\n\n**7: Tampa Bay Rays**\n\n**6: Colorado Rockies** \\-- Mostly a yawn here, but an inarguably common yawn, as saying someone's name during sex is both frequent and a good way to start a fight if said name is not accurate. But to paraphrase *When Harry Met Sally*, who's having good sex with someone named \"Ray\" or \"Marlin\"? \"Do me, Marlin.\" \"Slap my ass, Ray.\" \"I wish you'd stop saying 'oriole' so quickly, Marlin.\" No offense to anyone named Ray or Marlin. At least \"Rocky\" might be part of a boxing fantasy or something.\n\n**Tier Nine -- A Hodgepodge of Specific (But Foreseeable) Situations**\n\n**5: Minnesota Twins** \\-- \"So I was thinking \\*pant\\* that maybe one time \\*pant\\* we could do this with you and your twin...\" \"Shut up, Allen.\" \n\n**4: Houston Astros** \\-- This is the most important case for my \"it can be a part of a larger word or phrase\" rule, as \"astro\" just happens to be the prefix of a very popular brand of personal lubricant. And also maybe someone wants to engage in a little *Jetsons* roleplay. Ruh-roh.\n\n**3: San Francisco Giants** \\-- Oh, settle down. Lots of things can be giant in the bedroom. \"I'm trying to switch positions, but I can't because of your giant body pillow!\" \"You have a giant blackhead on your back!\" So on and so forth.\n\n**2: Cincinnati Reds** \\-- Much like the Giants, \"red\" can describe a lot of things, from Tina's red socks, to Allen's red pillowcase, to spanking Naomi's ass red, to Jorge shouting \"oriole\" before his ass gets any redder.\n\n**Tier Ten -- It Was Always Going to be the Angels**\n\n**1: The Angels of Whatever Place They Are From Now** \\-- I honestly tried to think of a more creative winner for these rankings, but much like Andrelton Simmons in his prime, \"angel\" just covers too much territory for anything to sneak by. It can be a man's name. It can be a woman's name. It can be a nickname. It can be a roleplaying fantasy. You might ask your partner to move their angel doll out of the way. It could even be a safe word if for some reason \"oriole\" hasn't yet occurred to you.\n\nAnd thus the Angels win their [second consecutive MLB ranking](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1ptadsd/ranking_the_mlb_teams_according_to_how_difficult/), thereby conclusively demonstrating that the league's competitive safeguards are nonfunctional and baseball is ruined. See you all in 2026.",

It should be noted that all 3 of these guys were projected to be drafted much later, if at all, and the fact that Brad moved up to obtain them seems an act of panic rather than logic. It’s well known that the best drafting teams “let the draft fall to them” like the Ravens, a team this regime has admitted to wanting to emulate.

He was a big piece to our team last year and I feel like he didn’ get enough credit.\n\nI do not. Outside of the games in which he got super hot from the perimeter, he was a consistently minus-value player on the court. Yay for his veteran presence and all, but the only thing he did well was hitting wide-open threes and attracting some gravity. He was bad at everything else, and terrible overall in the postseason. \n\nDenver offered him a guaranteed role, and I doubt the Pistons did the same. They needed minutes for Holland and Ivey and to replace Schroder with another handler (ultimately LeVert). \n\n> Also honorable mention: Simone fontechio. He’s had stretches where he struggled but he was a great all around wing and I think he also didn’t get the credit he deserves.\n\nI'm curious why you think so, because he was bad across the board last season. He shot league average from three in only a single month of the season, he routinely struggled on defense, and he provided pretty much nothing of particular value.\n\nHe started out strong with the Heat this season but has since taken a massive dump.",
