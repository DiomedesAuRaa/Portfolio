Believe in yourself: Four years ago, I was a two-star recruit playing high school football 30 minutes from Hard Rock Stadium with a dream of playing at the highest level. Two days ago, I became a National Champion in that same stadium, surrounded by the family who never stopped believing in me.\n\n2. Take the risk: When it’s 4th and 5 at the 12-yard line, go for it. \n\n3.

This is the final year of his contract, and as of Wednesday, he has yet to sign a new deal.

Petzing could do really well or he could be a bust. We don’t know. A lot of people seem to be trying to leverage themselves into an “I told you so” situation. Lots of name-calling and finger-pointing going around. I have my reservations about the decision but I’m not going to say next season is 100% a bust and nobody should be hoping that Petzing does poorly just so they can say they were right. It’s entirely possible to think this wasn’t the best decision AND want him to do well this year because he’s now the OC whether we want it or not. And him doing well means the lions offense is doing well which is something EVERYONE here should want. I’d be glad to be wrong about the hiring decision.\n\nEDIT: if you’d like to see a prime example of discussion devolving into name-calling check the longer thread in this comment.

I can't think of a more fitting personal introduction to my Lions fandom than that game vs. the Bears (if you know, you know). Anyway, the Lions sported these uniforms during that home game, in the Silverdome.\n\nIt was Kung Fu Billy Sims' rookie season, and he was ELECTRIFYING. \n\nAccording to my research, Sims and the Lions wore the pictured home uniforms from 1980 to 1981. They featured large and sparkly silver metallic numbers, and they POPPED. I got a Number 20 jersey, and I still remember loving how cool that shirt looked, with its big sparkly silver numbers, trimmed in white. \n\nThey say the Lions nixed these uniforms because opponents complained of glare from the numbers, which also made them hard to read on film or in sunlight. \n\nApparently in the 2026 season, the NFL is allowing new alternate uniforms to be added into the rotation, as part of its \"Rivalries\" program. How about we bring THIS uniform BACK? \n\nI mean the whole thing - the same shirt, the same silver pants with the blue pinstripes, and the same high ankle striped socks (we could keep our new and improved helmet). Why? Because this uniform looks GREAT! To my eyes, the BEST the Lions have ever looked! Tastes vary and I respect that, but that's my opinion about it, and I hope other fans would feel the same. Come on now, do the monochromatic Blueberries and Marshmallows really look better than THIS? To me, and to so many players, teams and fans past, the Lions are SILVER and BLUE, not monochrome. \n\nThis uniform has a great heritage too, as along with Sims, here are some other notable Lions who wore it: Doug English, Bubba Baker, Dexter Bussey and Eddie Murray. Wearing it, we could pay homage to Lions players and teams past, while enjoying the now with exciting players like Gibbs, all while looking super sharp! \n\nWould these silver numbers still cause the same problems today? I don't know - if they're sending people to Mars, don't you think they could engineer some jersey numbers to look the same, without blinding anybody? \n\nWe could call these the Disco Uniforms, because they sprung out of the Disco era, looking like a sparkling disco ball. Not all disco songs were bad! \n\nThere are full Lions games posted on youtube where they wear these uniforms, so you can see how they looked in real time. \n\nMaybe the Lions would listen to us if there's a popular fan movement for the Disco Uniforms, so who's with me on this? LET'S GOOOO!",

        "selftext": "When there is a player with an expiring contract like Tobias Harris, the usual online speculation is that he will be traded so that the Pistons will not lose him for nothing. However, looking at the multi-year financials of the team, letting Harris' contract expire will actually bring us something, which is 26M in freed cap space. This is significant because two players are up for a possible pay increase: Jalen Duren and Jaden Ivey. Duren's pay increase is more urgent because 1) he has transformed himself into a double double machine who is one of the better offensive centers in the league, possibly an All-Star, and 2) he is only being paid 6M this year so the increase in salary next year could be substantial. The freed up salary space from Tobias' expiring contract would hopefully be substantial enough to absorb most if not all of Duren's pay increase.\n\nThe Pistons under Langdon has already done this type of move last year. When Langdon traded Quentin Grimes for THJ and picks, the narrative was it was to move out a young player who does not actually want to play in Detroit and that Langdon was going for veteran leadership to guide the young roster. While those points might be true, I think the bigger reason is financial. If Grimes was retained, he would be up for a contract renewal as an RFA the same time as Cade Cunningham's big jump in salary to a rookie supermax at the start of the 2025-26 season. That could unnecessarily raise the team salary with four lottery picks still up for future possible substantial salary increases. Because Grimes was traded, THJ's salary coming off the books this year absorbed a substantial portion of Cade's pay increase and the team currently is still 26M away from the first apron.\n\nIf Tobias Harris is not traded and his contract expires, Langdon would have up to 33M to match an offer to Jalen Duren without increasing the team's current salary level. If they can negotiate Duren's salary to go up to 30M only, which is Jalen Johnson money, I think that would be the best outcome.\n\nNow for my take on Jaden Ivey who is also up for a contract renewal, this is where I go off the rails. LOL. I think Caris Levert plays a role in this.\n\nLevert was brought in to play Jaden Ivey's role before Jaden went down with an injury. Why Caris is still being played despite Ivey's return I think has a financial explanation. Levert is being kept and played to serve as a benchmark that Jaden has to hurdle. As long as Jaden is not outplaying Caris substantially (and I do not think he is), the Pistons would remain in an advantageous bargaining position in Jaden's negotiation for a pay increase. It's like, if you are barely outplaying Caris Levert who is being paid below 15M, why should we give in to your demand to get paid much more than 15M? So for those wishing that Levert be traded or to get much reduced playing time, monitor how Jaden is playing. Jaden has to answer the challenge of playing at a level high enough for Caris to become irrelevant in Jaden's negotiation with the Pistons' front office.",
