They have the 72nd most talented roster in the country and they are now 14-0 and #1 in the country. Yes, theres NIL/portal but its not like they’re bringing in 5 star guys. Its mostly players who were with Cignetti at JMU and overlooked 3 star guys. \n\nIts Moneyball on steroids. And lots of good coaching. \n\nEven if they lose, its already impressive.
