He says having a 100 OPS+ on the Pirates is not the same as having a 100 OPS+ on the Yankees or Dodgers. \n\nThe reasoning largely has to do with quality of opposition & how playing for a bad team (or with Pittsburgh in particular a bad lineup but good pitching) means you’re more likely to face better pitching later in games because you play in more close games to begin with. \n\nThey speak to an unnamed exec who basically validates Pham’s theory. They say most team models do incorporate this stuff & the impact isn’t huge or anything but it’s a legit take.\n\nHe also specifically calls out Jose Ramirez, says his numbers are being suppressed by playing for Cleveland, & that he wants to see weather-related variables integrated into defensive metrics.",

The only success they had was when they were \"cheating\" with oil burn and fuel-flow meters, so he left.\n\n\nThey got a brilliant youngling in the seat in the guise of Leclerc. He started gently but soon proved to be one of the fastest drivers ever. He expected to regularly fight for wins and, with a fair wind, a championship. Now? Charles looks (and somewhat acts) like an abused spouse. I can see him leaving, although I imagine a lot of social pressure to stay.\n\n\nNow they have Hammy partnering The Abusée. Ham has competitively driven several generations of cars. While he has a style and front end that he likes, he has shown himself able to work with what he has given the right headspace. Ham had done very little at Ferrari, and has expressed his frustration toward himself far more than toward Maranello.\n\n\n14 WDCs and hundreds of race victories between these drivers, hundreds of thousand of kilometres driven in anger, more experience, metrics, and intuition than the average neurology department, and Ferrari *still* can't do anything worth noting.\n\n\nMaybe, and here is my \"25+ years watching F1\" mouthy opinion... maybe it's *not* the drivers.",

The fact of the matter is, the deep bench that allows us to plug and play whoever’s skill set is needed at any point in time is what gives us  an advantage over most other teams. (And those teams don’t have Cade)\n\nWhat happens when we got against a team with amazing interior defense like Cleveland? We sub in players like Dannis to bomb them from outside\n\nWhat happens when the other team is a bit older and slow? Ivey speeds past everyone and hits a ton of easy transition lays \n\nWhat about when the starting lineup is off all together ? Sasser gets his own bucket off the dribble \n\nObviously there are more situations where players like BBall Paul and Levert shine (although Levert has been off lately) but remeber Levert is 38% from three this season. \n\nWe are young. Our window is HUGE as long as Cade and Duren are here. Everyone on this team understands their roles and are ready to play any given night and don’t complain to the media when they are a healthy scratch. They understand that some nights aren’t going to be theirs. They play hard defensively no matter what the score is.This is the team others dream of. No reason to mess it up for an offensive player who takes away from the defensive identity of the team and makes others work even harder to compensate their lack of defensive focus. ",

It’s not just an easy schedule. It’s a historical outlier. That’s why it’s being mentioned. It’s never been a point in decades because a schedule has never been this level of easy. \n\n1-2 against .500 teams. \n\nDidn’t play literally any of the top 15 defenses apart from Cleveland. No Seattle, Eagles, Chiefs, Lions, broncos, Texans, Rams, Vikings defenses which are all the best in league. \n\nPlayed the 2 outlier teams (Raiders and Jets) who were historically bad, 3 times. \n\nNearly 1/4 of Maye’s passing td’s came against the 2 x Jets games. The second game where the defense with 14 defensive injuries is probably the worst defense in NFL history (jets the last month of the season). \n\nStafford also had the 7th most passing TD’s in nfl history facing 8 teams .500 or better. \n\nThey had the No.1 HARDEST schedule in the league and the Pats had the easiest schedule in the last 832 schedules (26 years). Thats why it’s been brought up.",
