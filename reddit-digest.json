He didn’t even open his jaw. When he was a rookie, and during many of his early years on the Yankees he had a small gap between his two front upper incisors. He just forced the spit out the front of his teeth through that gap with his tongue and it looked so casual and nonchalant to me as a kid because he could spit AND smile at the same time. \n\nI tried hundreds of times to do this on the little league field but I’d just get spit all over my chin and shirt because I didn’t have teeth like that. I also routinely tried with sunflower seed shells which also obviously didn’t work because I was stupid. \n\nI stopped wearing my retainer as an adult and I now have a gap significant wider than Robbie cano’s ever was and I can spit like an all star now. I also wasted all the money my parents spent on braces. \n\nCano doesn’t have that gap anymore and I wonder if he can’t spit that way now. ",

A lot of it is about a controlled way of fitting into a system.”\n\nEriksen stops short of bemoaning the revival of set pieces — he still takes all of them, after all — and insists he is not ready for a “tennis, padel, golf” type retirement just yet. He has signed for two years at Wolfsburg, with a possible World Cup in between, and has his eyes on a fairytale ending at Ajax, “the full circle” of finishing where he started, with the batteries still charged.\n\n“I felt like I was the young guy for so many years and now I’m the oldest,” Eriksen says. “Even today in training, I’m like ‘you guys are just starting out, I know what you’re about to go through’. But my body feels good. I feel fresh. Every session, every game now, it’s nice. Let’s see how far we can take it.”",

In addition to the three expected opt-outs – Derrick Moore, Jaishawn Barham and Gio El-Hadi – the Wolverines were missing only running back Justice Haynes and linebacker Ernest Hausmann ... Haynes, meanwhile, broke his foot in late October and hasn't played since, but he is expected to join his teammates before the Citrus Bowl on Wednesday.\n\n... with the tumult within the coaching staff, how were the Wolverines able to hold things together?\n\n\"I feel like you could either go one of two ways: we either stay together or break apart,\" linebacker Cole Sullivan said. \"I'm dang sure, we don't want to break apart. That was really the only choice we had. And the camaraderie we have in the locker room. We always tell each other we love each other. It's not something we just say.\"\n\n\"[Once everything with former coach Sherrone Moore] happened, it's like 'Is everything going downhill from here?\" running back Bryson Kuzdzal said. \"I think it was smart that Biff came in right away – we never really went down at all. It was close, then Biff made sure we were going in the right direction, so I don't think we fell off at all.\"\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/o5mqebibpw9g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=749d6ef55ced0959c2eb9c3bf2749c04aea0a69e\n\n  \n  \nI wrote a post about how the Lions switched to an Air Coryell  Offensive scheme in 2025 with Johnny Mo.\n\n\n\n[It kinda blew up to my surprise... ](https://www.reddit.com/r/detroitlions/comments/1pw4ss1/lions_changed_schemes_the_data_shows_what_happened/) Thank you everyone!\n\n\n\nI shared how the Air Coryell scheme Is designed to attack a defense through stretching deep, and wide, using wide sets that run deep, with single back formations.  It sets teams up for explosives, by exploiting space through geometry.  \n\n\nWhich is exactly what happened.  The lions became the #1 team with 40y+ explosive throwing plays.  \n  \nThe problem was it ended up putting a young, injured offensive line under strain because Goff had to wait longer for routes to develop.\n\nOur 3rd down Yards Per attempt went from...\n\n**7.6 in 2024**\n\n**To 9.6 in 2025**\n\nAnd many asked, \n\n>***\"Didn't the increase happen because our run game was getting stopped and putting us in a place where we had to make up for it.\"***\n\n\n\nI intend to answer that, but there's more to the full picture.\n\n\n\nThe questions I'd like to answer are as follows;\n\n* How did our offensive line end up losing 2 pro-bowlers from the previous season?\n* How did the scheme affect our young line, and our run game?\n* And why did our offense really start to sputter mid season around game 10?\n\n  \nSo I guess kick back... grab a coffee because I'm going to go deep with this one.\n\n***\\*\\*Sips coffee\\*\\****\n\n  \n**Rewind back to January 2025.**\n\n>Brad Holmes in an interview said,   \n  \n*\"I don't care how good we ever get on the offensive line, that one right there is too important for not only our team, our quarterback, everything, it's our identity, man. So, I think just that alone is just—it's always going to be at the forefront.\"*\n\nI just want to point out, **Brad knows offensive line is important.**\n\nFollowing an exit interview with Zeitler, Brad was quoted as saying, \n\n>*\"We had conversations on exit day and then we'll just continue to have dialogue and just kind of see where it goes.\"*\n\nI say this to show, I think Brad was counting on Ragnow coming back (He has 2 years left on his contract, and he's a guy who deals with pain, so high percentage of return was there), and was actively talking to Zeitler, confident he'd want to return to chase a ring.  \n\nAs we know Zeitler ended up signing with the Titans, and the priority became Frank, and the youth.  The line would have looked decent with Frank, not perfect but solid.  \n  \nWe know the story - Frank announces retirement.  I'm going to go out on a lim and say this caught Brad off guard.  He hadn't pursued more offensive line help.  Colon was desperation.  \n\nThe reason this important is because by the time this happened, we had already changed schemes, and started installs.  It was too late to switch.\n\nAs we entered the season the famous quote, \"We're good.\" From DC was *for* the **team.** aka We believe in the guys we got.\n\nUp for argument, but In my opinion, a lot better than saying.  *We have young guys that just aren't ready.*\n\n# The Schematic Shift Away From Erhardt-Perkins (EP) To Air Coryell (AC)\n\nAs I stated in the previous post, Morton wanted to \"hunt more explosives\".  \n\nDC said about Jamo; \n\n>*\"The sky’s the limit for him... We expect him to have a huge season. We really do, man. He’s going to be one of these guys that we’re going to lean on this year and is really going to be big for us.\"*\n\n\n\nThey wanted to utilise Jaymo, and the best use of a high speed deep threat is Air Coryell. \n\n\n\nJaymo will stretch the defense with his speed, Amon will exploit the gap between the line backers and safeties, LaPorta will be there to pull Linebacker down, and Jahmyr is an extra safety valve to prevent teams from stacking the box.\n\n  \n  \nLaPorta is known as the Joker and is very important(this last point is important).\n\n  \n  \nSo on paper with our personal, the AC will be devastating to defenses.  The lions will ***out skill*** the competition, because it forces a defense to choose.  Either commit and get beat deep, or cover deep and get opened up in the middle.  \n\n  \n  \nEP on the other hand is a concept style offense - it can take many formations but a basic understanding is it's built around 6 - 8 yard consistent plays.  The death by 1000 cuts.  It's not about splash, it's about establishing rhythm, and playing a high percentage style.\n\n\n\nEP is around math, and law of averages.  Mathematically you will win based on clock control, possession, and creating an extra man advantage.  And that's what happened with close games last year.  On average we'd win without relying on big plays.  Games came down to the wire, and the Lions had the ball at the end.  \n\n\n\nOr we just couldn't be stopped because we were exploiting the opponents with Penei running across the back of the line to create a man disadvantage for the defense by adding another player.\n\n\n\nSo how do you know we switched? *Let's look at the stats.*\n\n\n\n||2024|2025 Early Johnny Mo|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Pre-snap motion|66%|23.3%|\n|During-snap motion|35.2%|14%|\n|Pre-snap shifts|2.4%|0%|\n\n\n\n# EP Pre-snap Motion\n\n**Pre-snap motion** is when a player like gibbs moves from one side of the formation to the other before the snap.\n\n\n\nIt's diagnosis, and It forces a defense to reveal whether the linebackers shift in a 'shell' which means they're in zone defense, or a linebacker follows Gibbs meaning they're in man coverage.\n\n\n\nThe system relies on offensive players to identify coverage (You need high IQ players for this), Goff then calls **Kill-Kill, Can-Can, Alert...** \n\n\n\nThese commands instruct the team as to run play A, B, or have a player run a hot route for pressure release, from a blitz.  (There's more to it, but these are the basics)  \n\n\nAn EP system is reactive to what the defense shows.  \n\n\nAC You don't rely on pre-snap motion.\n\n\n\nThe diagnostic is based on post-snap safety rotation.\n\n\n\nIn doing so you are always looking for a deep threat, this forces defenses to make choices, cover jaymo stretching the field high this allows under cut gashing plays because they're forced to respect Jaymo's speed, or play aggressive and allow deep balls.  \n\n\nYou'd see people complaining they're not throwing to Jaymo, but that's the system, his deep threat opens a defense vertically underneath. \n\n  \n  \nIn my opinion this is what Dan likes, he wanted to put his foot on the opposing teams throat and force them to make a choice where either choice resulted in Lions racking up yards and points.   (This is the system used by the greatest show on turf the St Louis Rams)\n\n\n\n# The Offensive Line In An EP vs AC Scheme\n\n\n\nThe choice to go AC scheme was largely because of the \"hunting explosives\", it's Johny Mo's specialty, we lost BJ so... who was going to make the play calls for an EP system?\n\nI believe the lions looked at their personal and wanted to use Jaymo more in his natural skillset, where he could influence the game more with deep routes.\n\nAlso having an under skilled, rookie heavy offensive line, AC is a better choice because there are more zone blocking schemes, and they don't rely on complex timing of O line push/pull, or mid count adjustments.   \n\n\nThe o-line is getting the play in the huddle and running it, this helps the rookie play faster and as we know playing fast early on is hard for rookies.  So lets remove the mental load of an EP scheme.\n\n  \nHere's a table of some stats between 24 and 25.\n\n\n\n||2024|2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|IOL Pull Rate|18%|8.8%|\n|Gap Scheme Runs|54%|31%|\n|Zone Scheme Runs|46%|69%|\n\n\n\nPush & Pull rate of the offensive line took a nosedive this year.  \n  \nPush pull is a core of the EP scheme.  Where push/pull (meaning the o-line players run across the back of the line to re-enforce the other side of the line post snap or up the middle to create a numbers mismatch.)\n\n\n\nYou need smart linemen (High IQ) and Agility, there is a lot of pre-snap processing and  this isn't easy for rookies.  The entire team is thinking like a qb to some extent.\n\n  \nYou can see that the EP works to create better odds.  If you run Penei from one side to the line to the other side you counter the defense with a play going from 2v2 to a 3v2.  \n\n\n(If you really want to understand football, this is a core understanding.  You split the field in two from where the ball is, and you create odd man advantages on either side of the split)  \n  \nEP is dynamic, but again you need high IQ and if the timing isn't right, plays are blown up.  \n\n\nThe EP with both Jahmyr and Monty on the field this creates stress for the defense.  It's also why Monty had more yards last year vs this year since there are more calls with both rb on the field.\n\n\n\n# The AC O-Line Problem\n\n  \nThe problem with the o-line in an AC scheme is that on throwing plays you need to wait for the routes to develop.  The issue was you were putting rookies, inexperience on an island forcing them into a system where they had to hold on longer than the EP system.\n\n\n\n||2024|2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Release Time|2.56s|2.78s|\n|Pressure Arrival|2.64s|2.47s|\n|Pocket Integrity|\\+0.08s|\\-0.31s|\n\n  \nWe know what happened, the o-line couldn't sustain.\n\nFrom a numbers perspective the young o-line was asked to hold longer before Goff released it because he had to wait for route development.  The major problem is the young guys couldn't hold the protection for that long and the line broke down.\n\n\n\n# LaPorta's Injury Was The Most Crucial Injury\n\n\n\nIn and AC style scheme the TE or LaPorta in our case is the most important player.\n\n  \nThe tight end in this scheme is known as the Joker.  \n\n\n\nHe's the only route runner that is consistently running 8-10 yard routes.  **He's the pressure release.**  When a blitz comes, when coverage breaks down, LaPorta is there to exploit the defense, and it worked when he was healthy.\n\n  \n\n\n||Weeks 1-9 (With Laporta)|Weeks 10-16 (Without LaPorta)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Points Per Game|**33.2**|21.4|\n|3rd Down Conversion %|**48.2%**|31.5%|\n|Goff Passer Rating Middle|**108.4**|76.2|\n|Sacks Allowed Per Game|**2.1**|3.8|\n|Amon Ra Success Rate|**61%**|44%|\n\n  \nAs you can see without LaPorta to bridge the gap between a power run or air pass, we were dead in the water and predictable.\n\n\n\nLosing him in my opinion **was the single most crucial piece that gave us an out**, when a defense blitzed or didn't respect the middle of the field.  It forces you to be honest or you'd pay for it.\n\n  \n***Losing LaPorta was a domino that mathematically broke the AC system.***\n\n  \nAfter LaPorta went down, defenses played '2-high shell' meaning two high safeties to contain the deep threat.\n\n\n\nNo LaPorta meant the Linebackers weren't pulled away allowing Amon to exploit the gap in the middle of the field.\n\n\n\nNo LaPorta meant they lost their best move blocker in the 'zone-stretch' run blocking, there was no blocker to seal the edge on lateral runs by Gibbs.\n\n\n\nThe Lions went from being a team that owned the middle, to a team that abandoned the middle of the field.\n\n\n\nAnd when the lions put in a backup TE, **teams knew that they were running.**\n\n  \nHere's a stat that shows what defenses thought, with LaPorta because he's a dynamic player and you didn't know if he was a run blocking or receiving.\n\n  \n\n\n||With LaPorta|Without LaPorta|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Run Success Rate|**48.2%**|36.5%|\n|Yards Per Carry|**5.1**|4.2|\n|Stacked Box %|**18%**|34%|\n\n  \nThe most damning is stacked box.  Without LaPorta the disrespect was there.\n\n\n\n# Route Tree Concept Of AC Doesn't Fit Amon Ra\n\n\n\nNow I say this looking back.  There was no way to know this before the season.\n\n  \nAmon Ra has an incredibly high football IQ.  He is also small.  This makes him perfect for EP.\n\n\n\nThe major difference for WR in AC scheme is Amon Ra is told to run a route tree.  It's puts a receiver in a geometric box.  He's told to run a \"6\" (a 12-to-15 yard curl).  He *must* reach that depth regardless of what the defenders are doing.\n\n\n\nIn the EP system Amon Ra had more freedom to 'sit' and find soft pockets of coverage, because of his football IQ.\n\n\n\nIf a linebacker drifted too far left, Amon-Ra would stop his route at 6 yards; if the linebacker stayed home, he’d push to 8.  (It essentially makes every route an option)\n\n\n\nBy putting Amon Ra into a box, it forced him to be more static.  \n\n\n\nHe's one of the best at sniffing out soft coverage and the system took that away from him.\n\n\n\n||2024|2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Drop Rate|2.8%|6.3%|\n\n\n\nThe combination of Goff being forced to wait for routes to develop, and Amon needing to run to specific points regardless of coverage, meant the drops were tight window drops.\n\n  \nHitting his hips, not completely missing, Goff under pressure and Amon needing to hit specific points left everyone under pressure to perform.\n\n\n\nIn the EP scheme this is where Amon and Goff have the most chemistry.  Everyone talks about it, since Goff sees the coverage and knows where Amon is going and they make plays happen. \n\n\n\nThis only happens with high IQ players, alternatively interceptions happen if players aren't on the same page.\n\n\n\n# TLDR;\n\n  \nThe offensive line was inexperienced, injured and not as talented, **we know this**.  But there is so much more to this game.\n\n\n\nForcing young players to hold on longer in and anchor  because we needed to wait for routes to develop made it hard on our young, and inexperienced interior offensive line.\n\n\n\n*Could the EP scheme have avoided this, by getting the ball out quicker?*  I don't know.  Maybe, but the pre snap processing might have been too much, and the line could have been exposed because of this.\n\n\n\nI believe Brad as caught off guard with Zeitler and Ragnow.  \n\n\n\nRagnow wanting to 'Unretire' seems like he felt bad (this is pure speculation on my part).\n\n\n\nEither way it wasn't planned for.\n\n\n\nThe AC system was a way to get Jaymo involved, and it did work for the most part.  Lions could rack up points.  \n\n\n\nBut it left us out of a rhythm,  and rhythm as I watched games seems to be very important.\n\n  \n\n\nThe LaPorta Injury was possibly the most crucial offensive injury, it exposed everything as the Joker role is a core piece of the AC scheme.\n\n\n\nIt made us predictable, static, and defenses knew what we were doing, and things fell apart after week 10.  The Vikings are so deceptive, it showed without LaPorta we really couldn't do anything.\n\n  \nAC isn't the best system for Amon Ra, or Penei.  I didn't go into depth, but Penei is one of the most athletic and best push/pull OT's in the league, he'll be better utilized in an EP or hybrid scheme.  \n\n\nThanks for reading this, as I learn more I'm sharing what I learn with all of you.\n\n\n\nIf fans like this this, then I'll have to do a defensive breakdown (because realistically this what collapsed our season, as always backed by data).  \n\nLets go Lions.

At this point is 80% even on the table. \n\nWith as much as the lions love to run man /quaters with man principles, starting to feel like we no longer have the personnel to run it. Anzo is likely gone and he was a big part of the lions ability to defend the run while not being a complete liability in pass coverage.\n\nReally its looking like tackle, guard, Center, edge?, fs, ss, slot cb and maybe even te all need to be addressed.

Was it something y'all cared about as much?\n\nGlad the team is doing incredible right now, hope this won't fade away. Just asking because I'm curious and because there are lots of people who've been watching longer than I've been.",
