        "selftext": "It's a bad analogy. It makes us all look stupid.\n\nI would absolutely love it if the Jays had a black hole at shortstop, because a person-sized black hole wouldn't let a single ball hit the ground anywhere on the field. It might even kill the visiting team, granted the \"home\" team had the good sense to actually stay home that day.\n\nSome better analogies for a poor defender include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. An unobstructed ureter.\n2. A disenchanted high school teacher who has given up on trying to make a difference.\n3. A broken airport metal detector.\n4. Someone who doesn't understand jokes.\n5. A traffic light where all three lights are green.\n6. A poorly positioned diaphragm.\n7. A priority target for a squad of storm-troopers.\n8. A trust-based low security Danish prison.\n9. A worry-free millennial.\n10. An overactive and scientifically anomalous immune system.\n11. An inanimate carbon rod.\n12. Crotchless boxers.\n13. A Watchmojo top 10 list.\n14. People who use the term 'acronym' when it is clearly an initialism.\n15. James Harden.\n16. An understudy fluffer who's been suddenly called into active duty.\n17. Someone who always misses their flight.\n18. Flattened villi from undiagnosed celiac disease.\n19. A Ben Shapiro video essay.\n20. Someone who had love, but didn't realize it until it was too late.\n21. Someone who doesn't know what to do with their hands when having a casual in-person conversation with someone they just met at a work-mandated social gathering.\n\nSo in closing, please be more careful with your analogies, and the next time someone calls YOU a black hole on defense, take it as a compliment and offer to expertly secure their balls like every black hole would.",
