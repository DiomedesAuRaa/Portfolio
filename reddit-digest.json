Only 4* teams have ever won without pulling this off. Currently only OKC has met the standard this season.

Kind of wild to think about when you look back at where they were over the last few seasons.\n\nGood luck to your guys!\n\n*(edit: It was 4 teams)\n\n1994–95 Houston Rockets\n\n2003–04 Detroit Pistons\n\n2005–06 Miami Heat\n\n2020–21 Milwaukee Bucks",
