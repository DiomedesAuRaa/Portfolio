I played scout team offense on his side of the practice field for several years - its not a plug and play system. It takes a lot of mental reps and thinking for his defense to succeed. So why bother sticking around to learn a defensive system when you can just transfer somewhere else to play and not have to worry about all of that. He is also really really tough (but fair). Which works as a head coach - since you answer to no one - but as a coordinator you have to make sure the head coach is OK with it. In today's game where players hit the portal if their feelings get hurt, can he be as hard nosed as he wants to be while still keeping players around?\n\nI love him to death but this isn't 2010 anymore (and its why I absolutely hate the current state of college football)",

However, according to new Jazz president of basketball operations Austin Ainge, Utah will not take active steps to protect that pick next season. When asked in his introductory press conference on Monday if the Jazz would engage in the sort of minutes manipulation that lost them so many games last season, Ainge responded simply \"you won't see that this year.\" That message has been taken to mean, broadly, that the Jazz do not plan to tank next season.\n\nHowever, Austin lies as easily as his daddy as the Jazz have started strategically resting players to throw games again. Lauri Markkanen has missed 6 games recently, all against tank opponents. The Jazz only have one center on their roster, Jusuf Nurkic, and they intentionally did not play him despite him being healthy to force the incredibly undersized Kyle Filipowski, Taylor Hendricks, Kyle Anderson, Ace Bailey, etc to play center for 48 minutes instead. The result? The Jazz gave up 144 points and then 138 points to the Mavericks without Flagg, AD, Kyrie, Lively, and Gafford.\n\nWhile the Jazz's roster is set up very nicely if they manage to get a top 3 pick this year, it's very strange to me that Austin Ainge's literal first statement as an important figure in the NBA was just such an extreme lie.",

Cavalli filed at 900k while the team filed at 825k. They have agreed to a deal at the exact midpoint of those figures, and have added a club option that has a very low chance of being exercised since it would be very difficult to get a raise that high from his Arb 2 year. They would just decline the option and take him to arbitration again if they wished to retain him. The buyout that will likely occur is therefore a sweetener that tilts the compromise slightly in Cavalli's favor, but is money that the Nationals don't have to put on their accounting sheet until next year.",
