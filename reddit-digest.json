He also won a World Championship in 2024.\n\nSince leaving OpTic and joining Falcons, though, it feels like the community has completely moved on. Players like Simp, Shotzzy, aBeZy, HyDra, Huke, etc. are now ranked above him with little debate.\n\nWas this due to role, team situation, meta changes, or just recency bias?

        "selftext": "Owners’ treatment of coaches is not far removed from predecessor Roman Abramovich, but they are lacking the on-field success to justify it\n\nNot content with flipping players, Chelsea appear to be embarking on a policy of flipping managers, too.\n\nIt would have suited their purposes if Pep Guardiola had stepped down and Manchester City came calling for Enzo Maresca, his former assistant, at the end of this season. Think of the compensation.\n\nInstead the Italian has gone early, an irretrievable breakdown in his relationship with the club’s hierarchy hastening his rapid exit and presumably leading to a wrangle over a pay-off.\n\nAnd so Chelsea are taking the same approach to managers as players: sign ones with potential on relatively low wages and long-term contracts (to protect the asset and spread the costs), then either keep them or sell/get compensation for them if they do not work out.\n\nMaresca was a bit of a punt. The Italian is relatively inexperienced at 45, and was plucked from Leicester City having led them to promotion to the Premier League. A fine achievement, but hardly the CV to take charge of a club of the scale of Chelsea. He had just one season in the Championship under his belt before being given a contract that runs to 2029 with an option for another year.\n\nContinuous turnover feels soulless \nBut we can expect his successor to be in a similar mould: a young coach, doing well and one who has the potential to do better. If not he, too, will be quickly moved on. Do not expect a big name, and certainly not a coach who will challenge the ownership and want a greater degree of control.\n\nIs Chelsea’s approach wrong? Not if it succeeds – the jury is emphatically out on this so far – although it does feel uncomfortable, given the turnover, and a bit soulless. It almost looks like a business-led experiment, trying to apply purely commercial principles to football and forgetting it is still a sport.\n\nNeither is that necessarily wrong. There is a balance, although it does not appear to exist in Chelsea’s unbalanced squad with players stockpiled and crucial experience lacking in key areas. Football clubs need to be run properly and not as an indulgence. With Chelsea, the jury is also out on that one, given the way they have gone about it.\n\nFor Chelsea, it would seem, the only regret is they are denied the multimillions in compensation if City one day wanted Maresca.\n\nEither way Chelsea are about to work with their fifth permanent head coach – plus an interim spell from Frank Lampard – since the Clearlake Capital-led takeover in May 2022.\n\nEghbali the new Abramovich\nEven by the standards of Roman Abramovich, the previous owner, that is some going.\n\nThe difference being, Chelsea fans will argue, that despite winning the Club World Cup and Europa Conference League under Maresca and despite the vast spending by BlueCo, they are no nearer becoming Premier League champions.\n\nAnd Abramovich brought that title five times and (effectively) twice won the Champions League, the second under Tuchel the year before the new owners arrived.\n\nFor Chelsea, the new normal is the old normal. To a degree. Abramovich famously sacked Carlo Ancelotti for finishing second the season after he won the club’s first – and only – league and FA Cup double.\n\nIt was a decision the Russian billionaire would come to regret, but there were few others during his reign.\n\nIt looks like the same applies to Behdad Eghbali. Chelsea are owned by a large consortium of investors, with Clearlake the principal. The remainder of the shares are held by Todd Boehly and fellow investors.\n\nBut more and more it is said that Eghbali, co-founder and managing partner of Clearlake, a private equity firm with $90bn in assets, calls the shots. It will have primarily been his decision to remove Maresca.\n\nIt means Eghbali has another big decision to make. Chelsea have nine games in four competitions for a new manager in January. Flunk those and the season turns to dust. Who knows, they may even be in search of another head coach.",
