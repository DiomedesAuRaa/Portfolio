So I go to the building where I spend most of my calendar year, the football facility. I thought I would receive guidance and clarity, as it was a life-changing experience.

I’d put him 3rd or 4th because of that depending on how much you value defense (in favor of Duncan) or evolving the game (point for Curry).",
