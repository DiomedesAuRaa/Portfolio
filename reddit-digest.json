The set came from Costco and its actually really good quality. The computer screens light up when plugged in but the cable it comes with is very short but overall the pieces fit very well together and definitely recommend anyone pick them up if they see then at their local Costco warehouse.

        "selftext": "I've been into F1 since the early 90s as a kid, and up until recently I never met *anyone* in the UK who liked the sport. Various people who'd casually watch a race, but no one was into it. Even did marshalling at a British race track for a bit (Oulton Park) and all the other marshals said they never bothered do the F1 at Silverstone because it was \"boring\". \n\nMost people seemed to think the same - races too long (despite most not being much longer than a football match if you account for half-time), annoying sound, no real action, etc. I've no idea how the British GP sold out every year or where they all came from!\n\nWhen F1 finally exploded in popularity over the past several years, it was basically a life-long dream come true. Finally other people who liked it, it being discussed in other media, even in my work (dance music industry) DJs often play F1 events now and while I've not managed it yet, I am hoping to be able to get to a race with a DJ through work. I remember when the only entertainment at the British Grand Prix for example was just Eddie Jordan's band, god rest him.\n\nThere's a slight downside in that there's an increase in \"football fans\" which studies have shown does involve a similar part of the brain to religion, and they simply *cannot* accept that \"their\" driver/team is in the wrong if an incident occurs. It's childish and offputting, but no big deal, easy to ignore, and it's a small price to pay for a hugely increased popularity as most new fans are brilliant and it's great to have people to just share the interest with. I also maybe don't really get that aspect of hardcore fandom as I've never been into one driver or team, I just like the sport in general.\n\nI'd even, tentatively, say that the change in engine noise is a huge help. F1 on in the background in a pub or bar say, is now just like any other sport, not an intensely annoying noise for people who don't like engines and fast cars. I personally massively miss the old sound, but I *get* why the new reduced sound works. And it's still there a bit, it's just more tolerable to a wider number of people.\n\nSo fellow veterans, what are your thoughts on this? And newcomers, how do you perceive the attitude of older F1 fans in general? Welcoming, or hostile? ",

This season, I say we make some noise and push Isaiah Stewart to be in the 6MOTY conversation.\n\nThe idea came to me when Stew won Eastern Conerence Defensive Player of the Month despite playing off the bench and earning just over 20 mins a game. I know that 6MOTY is almost always rewarded to subs who bring instant offensive firepower. But the prominent names in the sixth man talk right now are not really running away with it. Ajay Mitchell, Naz Reid, and Keldon Johnson are averaging just 3 to 4 ppg more than Stew. NAW's name comes up in some lists, but he has more games as a starter than a sub so he should not be considered.\n\nStew has bigger impact as a sub even if his contribution offensively is not huge. Which of the other 6MOTY candidates serve as a symbol of the identity of their teams? Cade of course is the face of our franchise, but the Pistons are currently leading the East because they are the 2nd best defensive team in the league and Stewart is the face of our defense.\n\nISAIAH STEWART FOR NBA SIXTH MAN OF THE YEAR!\n\n",

In the Warriors vs. Thunder game last night (1/2/2026), Steph, Draymond, and Jimmy Butler all sat on the bench. These are the most expensive tickets in the league; no doubt these particular tickets were listed at a higher price because of dynamic pricing. \n\nI’ve been a fan for years of the NBA,\nListened to multiple weekly podcasts across The Ringer/Grantland/ESPN and I’ve refused to buy tickets over the years because of high probability a star or stars would be sitting. This should be a civil lawsuit for the fans who constantly get mistreated by a monopolistic enterprise and have no recourse to choose another product. It’s a travesty and why I hope no other leagues take on tanking or load management practices. F*** the NBA.\n\n***Addition to the post***\nI want to be clear, my issue isn’t with the Players. This is an ownership/Front Office issue. A lot of these load management games are determined well in advance with the training staffs/medical teams. This is a problem the owners/Adam Silver could solve, and as fans we’ve let them off the hook for their greed. It’s a horrible situation for fans and I feel bad for kids who looked forward to seeing Steph for the first time and didn’t see him. It’s greedy, and it’s wrong. ",

Its mostly players who were with Cignetti at JMU and overlooked 3 star guys. \n\nIts Moneyball on steroids. And lots of good coaching. \n\nEven if they lose, its already impressive. But if they win it all, its some Norman Dale legendary shit. ",

        "selftext": "The winter classic is the premier regular season event for hockey and has had some great moments and venues (The Big House, Notre Dame, Fenway)\n\nYesterday they played their winter classic at the Marlins stadium that ended up looking like they just played hockey in a concrete warehouse. It was 60 degrees. A “winter classic” in 60 degree weather. Barely even outdoors (they retracted the roof)\n\nIce hockey is inherently a niche sport. For the premier event of the league, lean into northern cities and create a real atmosphere. The south will likely never become hockey hotspots, and that’s ok.\n\nGoing from the big house with snow and ice all around to the Marlins stadium with the players coming out to an instrumental version of Despacito is a disgrace",
