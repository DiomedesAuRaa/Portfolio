I think there was a general realization that consistent secondary scoring/creation is going to have to come from some where in the playoffs and Duren has earned that opportunity.  \n\nIf you recall, after a really impressive stretch early in thr season, teams started showing him more bodies and forced him into passivity.  Curious to see how he handles it this time around.",

But the show’s immersive lore invited lots of online discourse between episodes, which inevitably resulted in a plethora of Lost themed podcasts. \n\nSome might say Lost was responsible for the growth of the podcasting industry. At the very least, it was a major influence. The first podcast I ever listened to was a Lost podcast. \n\nOne of the early (and IMO best) Lost podcasts was “Make Your Own Kind of Music with Scott and Steve”, which listeners simply called ‘MYOKOM w/SaS’ (if the title is confusing, it’s a Lost reference.) \n\nAnyway, the founders of the podcast were two guys named Craig and Dylan. However, Dylan joined the Navy in spring 2006, towards the end of season two, and the show ultimately ended, but not before leaving a major mark on the Lost podcasting community. \n\nIn fact, a rather large community of listeners formed during the short amount of time that MYOKOM w/SaS ran, and from what I recall at least three different Lost podcasts spawned directly from that community and prospered for several years. (My favorite from that group was Dharmalars, which still produces episodes from time to time!)\n\nAnd while MYOKOM w/SaS was over, Craig, who was the brains behind the operation and essentially ran the community, would check in periodically. In fact, him and Dylan even reunited in 2010 and did an episode after Lost’s finale aired. \n\nDue to Craig launching the first pod among this strong, albeit niche community, and his active involvement in said community, he earned the nickname “The PodFather” and people have been calling him that dating back to circa 2006/2007. \n\nWhenever I hear Bill get called that name I think back to Craig, and how he was the OG.",
