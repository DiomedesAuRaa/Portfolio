Everyone is talking about Brahim Diaz today, but even Zidane, your god, did it in a big game (the 2006 World Cup final). Great players have tried this move. When you succeed, people applaud, but when you miss, they criticize you. He's a magnificent player, whom I know because I once had him on the Spanish national team. I understand that it's difficult, but you have to accept it because it's still a sport. The most important thing is the values you can show to younger players. We mustn't exaggerate; it's not murder, after all.\n\nPSG coach Luis Enrique defended Brahim Diaz during his press conference ahead of the match between Sporting Portugal and PSG (Tuesday, 9 p.m.), after the Moroccan international missed a penalty in the Africa Cup of Nations final against Senegal (0-1 a.e.t.).\n\n“We talked about it on the bus,” he acknowledged. \"Everyone is picking on Brahim, but I remember Zidane, who is a god, the god of soccer, and who took a Panenka penalty in the World Cup final (in 2006 against Italy, 1-1 a.e.t., 3-5 on penalties). Many players have done it. When you succeed, everyone applauds, but when you miss in a game like this, everyone criticizes you harshly. I know Brahim well because I selected him for the Spanish national team, and I would like to say that this is sport, nothing more. You have to show that you can win, and that you can lose. We mustn't go overboard. He didn't do anything wrong, he didn't murder anyone. (Addressing the journalists) You who have the power to express your opinion, try to show respect for a young player who is under a lot of pressure. That's what I wanted to say on the subject...\"\n\n*« Today, we talked about it on the bus. Everyone’s talking about Brahim, but I remember Zidane, who is a football god. He did it in a World Cup final, and I remember Sergio Ramos did it in a big match as well. When you score, nobody says anything, everyone applauds, but when you miss, there’s a lot of harsh criticism for a player who is truly outstanding. I know him—I called him up for the Spanish national team for a match. He’s an exceptional player, and this is very unfair*. »\n\n  \n“We talked about it today on the bus. Everyone is talking about Brahim, but I remember Zidane Zidane, who is a soccer god and did it in the World Cup final,” said Luis Enrique ahead of the Champions League match between Sporting CP and PSG at Alvalade. “I remember Sergio Ramos doing that. If you score a great goal, everyone applauds. But if you miss, there are a lot of negative comments.”\n\n“Brahim Díaz is a magnificent player, I know him, I called him up for a game with the Spanish national team. He is an exceptional player and a very good person. I understand that it is difficult to accept. It was strange, but it's sport, nothing more,” explained Luis Enrique, who tried to play down the issue. \"The most important thing is the values you can convey to people. Brahim is not a murderer or a bad person.

Sal quipped something about it at first, Bill pressed on, and Sal just gave no response to each catch’s description as Bill continued to converse with himself. \n\nAdd this on top of Bill’s utter disbelief that anyone would think Stafford’s 46 TD 8 INT season is MVP-worthy, and I think the bias is starting to eat at Sal. \n\nYou can tell he actually wants to call him out more aggressively, but we all have those more childish friends who need to be treated with kid gloves, and Bill is one of them.
