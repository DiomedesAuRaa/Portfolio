I've watched quite a few matches and I love it.\n\nTo deepen my understanding, could someone explain in detail how a French football season works? (signing, transfer approval, regular season, playoffs, Heisman Trophy…)\n\nI'd also like to know how players balance their professional and personal lives (classes, transfer approval, etc.).\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nedit 1: Thank you for all your initial messages, I've already learned a lot of new things, I love the community.\n\nFYI:\n\nMy favorite team: UMIAMI (I love the city, it was a natural fit; I followed the whole season and knew I'd made the right choice after crying tears of joy following their win against A&M)\n\nFavorite player: Johnny Manziel. I've watched all his highlights, interviews, and game replays. I love his vibe; it's a shame he didn't make it in the NFL.\n\nFavorite game: I've watched a few classics, but for now, it's still the 2013 Iron Bowl. Chris Davis's comeback kick made me discover and fall in love with the CFB. (If you have any other games to suggest, feel free, preferably old school ones)",

This plan would make us the best team in the NFL for a few years and still leave $6M in reserve for depth and mid-season moves. Plus it brings a few Michigan men back to our great state.\n\n**The Jared Goff Restructure:** To make this work without gutting the roster, we performed a major restructure on Jared Goff’s contract.\n\n* **Structure:** We convert $55M of Goff's base salary into a signing bonus and spread it over his remaining years (including a void year).\n* **The Savings:** Opens $40.3M of usable space into our 2026 budget.\n\n**Trade for Maxx Crosby:**\n\n* **Lions Receive:** DE **Maxx Crosby**\n* **Raiders Receive:** 2026 1st Round Pick, 2027 1st Round Pick, and DT **Alim McNeill**.\n* **Cap:** By trading two 1st-rounders and Alim McNeill, we essentially swap McNeill's large 2026 cap hit for Crosby's, while simultaneously dodging the $7M–$8M in immediate cap space typically reserved for first-round rookie contracts over the next two seasons.\n\n**Key Free Agency & Draft Moves:**\n\n* **Draft:** Let's hope we can pull off **Gennings Dunker** (2nd Round), **Rod Moore** (4th round, we know how Brad loves a guy off injury), and **Bryce Boettcher** (5th) for LB depth.\n* **O-Line:** Sign **Tyler Linderbaum** (C) and move **Graham Glasgow** back to guard. Drafted **Gennings Dunker (Iowa)** in the 2nd for LT.\n* **Secondary:** Sign **Tariq Woolen** and **Jabrill Peppers.** Tariq would be a perfect fit for the man-to-man press defense we could run with Hutch and Crosby. Jabrill helps fill a hole while BB recovers. Keep **Maddox** and **Nick Whiteside** for depth. Draft Rod Moore for more depth.\n* **LB:** Sign **Devin Bush** to work as our Anzalone coverage replacement.\n* **DL:** Re-sign **Roy** **Lopez** and go all in on Tyleik.\n* **The Exits:** Taylor Decker retired. DJ Reader and Alex Anzalone left in free agency.\n* **If Decker stays:** Not too much needs to change, in this scenario, we still draft Dunker. We could cut Glasgow, if we're tight on cap, and start Dunker at guard until Decker retires.\n\n# 2026 Detroit Lions Depth Chart\n\n**Offense**\n\n* **QB:** Jared Goff\n* **RB:** Jahmyr Gibbs, David Montgomery\n* **WR:** Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jameson Williams, Isaac TeSlaa\n* **TE:** Sam LaPorta, Brock Wright\n* **LT:**  Gennings Dunker (R) / Taylor Decker (if he doesn't retire)\n* **LG:** Graham Glasgow / Gennings Dunker (see above)\n* **C:** Tyler Linderbaum\n* **RG:** Tate Ratledge\n* **RT:**  Penei Sewell\n\n**Defense**\n\n* **DE:** Maxx Crosby, Aidan Hutchinson\n* **DT:** Tyleik Williams, Roy Lopez\n* **MLB:** Jack Campbell\n* **WLB:** Devin Bush\n* **SLB:** Derrick Barnes\n* **CB1:** D.J. Reed\n* **CB2:** Terrion Arnold\n* **Slot:** Tariq Woolen\n* **FS:** Kerby Joseph, Rod Moore (R)\n* **SS:** Jabrill Peppers, Brian Branch (when he returns)\n\n**Reserve Cap Space:** \\~$6 Million\n\nAny flaws in this (other than wishful thinking)? Do we think something like this makes sense? Do we think Brad could pull it off?  ",

You would need to hope Hutch and Crosby are enough to balance that. \n\nThe left side of the O-line would be extremely suspect if Decker retires, no matter how NFL ready you think Dunker is (and to be honest if he’s a left tackle dropping to 50ish then you don’t think he’s that ready) he’s a rookie and his only help being Glasgow in a position he had his worst season in is begging Goff to get injured. \n\nThe trade is also based on the idea that McNeill is both overpayed (someone we need to get rid of) and a worthwhile trading piece. Also “dodging first round contract payments” is a funny way to say “we’re much more likely to have no cheap high level players for a few years”.",
