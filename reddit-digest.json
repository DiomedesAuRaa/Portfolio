        "selftext": "Source:   [ https://pr.nba.com ](https://pr.nba.com)\n\nNEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2026 - The NBA announced today that it has fined two teams related to the management of their rosters for recent games.\n\nThe Utah Jazz organization has been fined $500,000 for conduct detrimental to the league related to the team's games against the Orlando Magic on Feb. 7 and the Miami Heat on Feb. 9. During those games, the Jazz removed two of the team's top players, Lauri Markkanen and Jaren Jackson, Jr., before the beginning of the fourth quarter and did not return them to the game, even though these players were otherwise able to continue to play and the outcomes of the games were thereafter in doubt.\n\nIn addition, the Indiana Pacers have been fined $100,000 for violating the Player Participation Policy in connection with the team's game against the Utah Jazz on Feb. 3. Following an investigation, including review by an independent physician, the NBA determined that Pascal Siakam, a star player under the Policy, and two other Pacers starters, neither of whom participated in the game, could have played under the medical standard in the Policy, including by playing reduced minutes. Alternatively, the team could have held the players out of other games in a way that would have better promoted compliance with the Policy.\n\n# \"Overt behavior like this that prioritizes draft position over winning undermines the foundation of NBA competition and we will respond accordingly to any further actions that compromise the integrity of our games,\" said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. \"Additionally, we are working with our Competition Committee and Board of Governors to implement further measures to root out this type of conduct.\"",

In the post-refueling era the only real strategy components we have is tire / pit strategy, so the idea that they’ll have to be deciding when to push and when to recuperate battery power is going to add a fun chess-like element to it. The idea that F1 should be about pushing flat out in perfect conditions is relatively new, and kind of boring to me. I don’t want slot cars, I want competing technology, strategies, and some unpredictability thrown in. \n\nI grew up watching during the V12 / V10 era, but as much as I miss that sound (and oh do I ever) I just want the cars to go fast and be able to pass anywhere. This is a step toward that, IMO. I wish we could go back to the days of lightweight, small cars that the drivers can flick around like karts, but unfortunately the genie is out of the bottle and isn’t going back in.",

Washington would want to stick it to Utah for thinking they’re the worst team and try their hardest to not give them the #1 pick. \n\nwhy is this a stupid idea? what are the flaws of this system? ",
