        "selftext": "I've been into F1 since the early 90s as a kid, and up until recently I never met *anyone* in the UK who liked the sport. Various people who'd casually watch a race, but no one was into it. Even did marshalling at a British race track for a bit (Oulton Park) and all the other marshals said they never bothered do the F1 at Silverstone because it was \"boring\". \n\nMost people seemed to think the same - races too long (despite most not being much longer than a football match if you account for half-time), annoying sound, no real action, etc. I've no idea how the British GP sold out every year or where they all came from!\n\nWhen F1 finally exploded in popularity over the past several years, it was basically a life-long dream come true. Finally other people who liked it, it being discussed in other media, even in my work (dance music industry) DJs often play F1 events now and while I've not managed it yet, I am hoping to be able to get to a race with a DJ through work. I remember when the only entertainment at the British Grand Prix for example was just Eddie Jordan's band, god rest him.\n\nThere's a slight downside in that there's an increase in \"football fans\" which studies have shown does involve a similar part of the brain to religion, and they simply *cannot* accept that \"their\" driver/team is in the wrong if an incident occurs. It's childish and offputting, but no big deal, easy to ignore, and it's a small price to pay for a hugely increased popularity as most new fans are brilliant and it's great to have people to just share the interest with. I also maybe don't really get that aspect of hardcore fandom as I've never been into one driver or team, I just like the sport in general.\n\nI'd even, tentatively, say that the change in engine noise is a huge help. F1 on in the background in a pub or bar say, is now just like any other sport, not an intensely annoying noise for people who don't like engines and fast cars. I personally massively miss the old sound, but I *get* why the new reduced sound works. And it's still there a bit, it's just more tolerable to a wider number of people.\n\nSo fellow veterans, what are your thoughts on this? And newcomers, how do you perceive the attitude of older F1 fans in general? Welcoming, or hostile? ",

Not being prepared to loose your all decade center who didn’t practice for a season and a half is also a huge mistake.\n\nThose two mistakes combined are why the Lions are not in the playoffs this season.\n\nGraham should have been considered great interior depth this past offseason, and far more attention given to the O line in general.",

Add in that after Sewell, Brad essentially hoped that mid to late round projects like Manu and Mahogany would be able to become reliable starters, and you can see how the line fell apart fast.\n\n\nThe biggest crime was not making a move for Frank’s successor sooner, and no, I don’t buy drafting a life-long guard in Tate with the plan to move him to center. Frank talked retirement for years, and I get he announced it after the draft, but even Penei on St Brown’s podcast that everyone knew he was done after the Commander’s game. If the players knew, Brad and Dan knew as well or they are inept as hell. \n\n\nGoing into the year with the plan for Graham as your starting center was always a disaster. Look at Philly - Kelce talked of retirement as well so they planned for his successor before he left. Brad didn’t do this with Frank.",

        "selftext": "For non cfb fans, Indiana is the losingest program in cfb history. They had zero 10 win seasons in their 125 year history before Cignetti showed up and he’s had 2 in a row. They hadnt won a bowl game since 1991 until they demolished Bama in the Rose Bowl a few days ago.\n\nThe craziest part is their roster. They have the 72nd most talented roster in the country and they are now 14-0 and #1 in the country. Yes, theres NIL/portal but its not like they’re bringing in 5 star guys. Its mostly players who were with Cignetti at JMU and overlooked 3 star guys. \n\nIts Moneyball on steroids. And lots of good coaching. \n\nEven if they lose, its already impressive. But if they win it all, its some Norman Dale legendary shit. ",

        "selftext": "I’m sure the NBA isn’t going to miss me, but I’m tired of paying attention to a league that has no regard for their fans. In the Warriors vs. Thunder game last night (1/2/2026), Steph, Draymond, and Jimmy Butler all sat on the bench. These are the most expensive tickets in the league; no doubt these particular tickets were listed at a higher price because of dynamic pricing. \n\nI’ve been a fan for years of the NBA,\nListened to multiple weekly podcasts across The Ringer/Grantland/ESPN and I’ve refused to buy tickets over the years because of high probability a star or stars would be sitting. This should be a civil lawsuit for the fans who constantly get mistreated by a monopolistic enterprise and have no recourse to choose another product. It’s a travesty and why I hope no other leagues take on tanking or load management practices. F*** the NBA.\n\n***Addition to the post***\nI want to be clear, my issue isn’t with the Players. This is an ownership/Front Office issue. A lot of these load management games are determined well in advance with the training staffs/medical teams. This is a problem the owners/Adam Silver could solve, and as fans we’ve let them off the hook for their greed. It’s a horrible situation for fans and I feel bad for kids who looked forward to seeing Steph for the first time and didn’t see him. It’s greedy, and it’s wrong. ",

For the premier event of the league, lean into northern cities and create a real atmosphere. The south will likely never become hockey hotspots, and that’s ok.\n\nGoing from the big house with snow and ice all around to the Marlins stadium with the players coming out to an instrumental version of Despacito is a disgrace",
