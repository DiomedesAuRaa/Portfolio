Quandre Diggs was a talented safety under some awful Lions teams stuck with  the moribund Patricia-Quinn leadership tandem.    His talent wasn't properly recognized and he was virtually pawned off to Seattle for a mere 5th Round Pick.\n\nIn Seattle, he immediately blossomed into an absolute asset in the secondary, corralling 18 Interceptions in 4.5 Seasons with the Seahawks and appearing in 3 Pro Bowls from 2020-2022.\n\nHowever, at the end of the 2022 season, he suffered a dislocated ankle and a broken leg.     His play had noticeably declined in 2023, primarily from the linger effects of the injury.  After the team hired Mike Macdonald, they decided to move on from Diggs\n\nDiggs spent the entirety of 2024 and a majority of the 2025 season with the Titans, struggling to find a consistent role due to injury and the instability of a team in flux between eras.     Like fellow Seahawks-to-Titans teammate, Tyler Lockett, he requested his release midseason and was granted that request in November\n\nIt all came full circle for Diggs, as he was picked up later that month by his old team, spending the remainder of the 2025 season largely on the Seahawks practice squad, save for four special teams snaps in a game against the Vikings.\n\nThis last stop proved quite fruitful for Diggs' legacy, even if, by his own admission, he didn't contribute much to the 2025 incarnation of the team (beyond his respected role as a veteran voice in a locker room of mostly young studs)\n\nIt culminated in a ring, which most Seahawks fans would agree is well deserved for a player who contributed so much to the Seahawks teams around the turn of the decade.\n\nI wonder how many plays in NFL history would foreshadow a link between two players, who's greatest achievement would come later, united on a completely separate organization",

The funniest thing the NHL could do is institute a complete copycat of the inseason tournament and watch their players take it very seriously and make it VERY meaningful to fans.\n\nFor most of my life NBA was my favorite league with hockey completely off my radar. That’s crept down to about a 60/40 split in favor of nba now.
