In fact, there is only one case of two Hall of Famers being born on the same day: Frank Thomas (class of 2014) and Jeff Bagwell (class of 2017) were both born on May 27, 1968.

        "selftext": "I have always wondered why F1 was so dead set against moveable aerodynamic devices for so long, and today I ran across an explanation. \n\nThe origin was in 1970. Aero was really coming in, and the Lotus 49 was using a rear wing raised way up high, on these spindly supports (think kind of like a Top Fuel dragster). And the supports were attached to the suspension, instead of the body, so the wing would actually move around.  \n\nDuring a race, one of them broke off Jochen Rindt's car, and he crashed. The setup was blamed, and thereafter, the rule was changed so wings had to be attached to the body. (It didn't help that Colin Chapman had a reputation for building cars so light that they posed a hazard to his drivers.)\n\nI'm sure some people already know this, but it was new to me, so I thought I'd post.

He’s got bad mechanics, his footwork is extremely sloppy, often it looked like he had no idea what he was seeing or supposed to be seeing, and the decision making was poor. He’s not beyond repair. Frankly knowing the mess that was the coaching staff this season should for reason for grace. So many fans want to bail on him or are having buyers remorse and it’s like he was a true freshman in a bad situation! Another good program would still sign up to take him. Now we’ve hired a good offensive staff, we’ve hired a QB coach, the OL will continue to get better, hopefully the pass catchers will be better and he takes steps forward. ",

        "selftext": "The team is in a good place defensively. But our offense sputters because of our four Top 5 picks, only Cade plays with purpose on offense. \n\nAusar sort of found his niche as a cutter and playing in the dunker spot although he still drops too many balls handed off to him in the paint. When Jaden and Ron receives the ball in the half court, I am almost expecting that they will give the ball up because they do not (yet) have the craftiness to create a shot other than through a straight-line drive or on a fastbreak.\n\nSometimes we mock Tobias and Caris but their ability (and willingness) to create gives Cade mental breaks during the game. Sasser's value in the past two games is not just in him making his shots (although of course that is valuable!) but also in his willingness to create offensive opportunities for himself and also for others. \n\nRon is still really young (he is younger than Derik Queen, hahaha) and he actually has willingness to take a shot. He just does not have much of an offensive bag yet. I am more of hoping that Jaden would be the one to take the offensive leap, because Ron at least already has a niche role on defense as an agent of chaos. Jaden is just...there. He is working his way back from a long injury break, but I hope that by his 25th game, he would find a clear role. Cade just looks mentally exhausted on offense.",

He answers a lot of the concerns the team has right which, the need of a true secondary ball handler/ #2 option, natural 3pt shooter, someone who can reliably create their own shot outside of Cade, and also can take some of the focus away from Cade. Again it's only a two game sample size but in those two games he's played either less than or slightly more than Robinson and put up 19pts and 18pts respectively. I think tonight he had 18/2/4 with 2 steals? So not only can he get you buckets, he's good help on defense. I just think it should be strongly considered by JB to let him get a start or two just to see if it's maybe a \"flash in the pan\" or is he making the team stronger/more dangerous as a starter.
