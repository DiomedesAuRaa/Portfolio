        "selftext": "Raiders: Signs are pointing toward another reset in Las Vegas, where Pete Carroll’s status is very much in doubt. It would be, at this point, a major surprise if Carroll returns for a second season.\n\nBrowns: Everyone in Cleveland has been frustrated with the results over the past two seasons. But owner Jimmy Haslam has planned to wait for the final results – including Sunday’s game against Cincinnati – before finalizing any decisions (…) The expectation is that Browns brass will regroup on Monday before deciding how to proceed.\n\nCardinals: Gannon, though, said this past week that he felt \"good” about his job status. While owner Michael Bidwill has made no public statement, and there are no guarantees until he does, the general sense has been that Gannon will get another year -- this time with a QB that he’s involved in selecting along with GM Monti Ossenfort.\n\nFalcons: However, the team has a thorough process for evaluating leadership, staff and players every year and no changes, or additions, will be put in motion until the season ends. The team has been keeping the focus on Sunday's game against the Saints and trying to finish strong.\n\nColts: Irsay-Gordon and those in charge in Indy have remained tight-lipped, not offering any indication into which direction they will go. And while there are no outward signs of major changes on the horizon, there’s also no track record to indicate how Irsay-Gordon might proceed.\n\nDolphins: Chairman Stephen Ross has made no public statement on the future of head coach Mike McDaniel, who is under contract through 2028. But signs continue to point towards McDaniel returning for a fifth season.\n\nCommanders: After a frustrating 4-12 campaign, the Commanders are expected to retain the football leadership that helped them reach the NFC Championship game last January, including coach Dan Quinn and GM Adam Peters. But other changes could be coming. Quinn took over defensive play-calling duties from Joe Whitt Jr. in November and it’s likely Washington will have a new DC. Although Whitt is a trusted confidante and has worked with Quinn for years, a new defensive voice would make sense, and Washington has done research to that effect. Changes on offense also are possible, though it’s not yet clear how, or when, those could come about. Offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury is expected to get head coach interviews and could be headed elsewhere.\n\nBengals: Bengals head coach Zac Taylor is not going anywhere. Since being eliminated from playoff contention, Cincinnati has blown out the Dolphins and Cardinals, reminding everyone how their offense can look like with ﻿﻿Joe Burrow﻿﻿ and his receivers healthy and available. The question is what Cincinnati will do on the defensive side of the ball. Al Golden’s unit has been a source of frustration all season. Yet the Bengals' defense has slowly and steadily improved, hitting pause on any discussions of moving on. Taylor and the team’s brass will go through their decisions once the season ends.\n\nJets: The Jets are bringing back Aaron Glenn for a second season as head coach. The question is, how significant will changes be to his staff? Glenn already has fired his defensive coordinator Steve Wilks. Homework on replacements has already begun, with a search to follow as soon as the season ends. Changes to the rest of the staff are certainly possible. Glenn has said on multiple occasions the past two weeks that he was going to evaluate his staff\n\nCowboys: While the Cowboys are out of the playoff chase at 7-8-1, there were enough bright moments in the season’s second half to earn coach Brian Schottenheimer a second season. But other staff changes could be coming. Owner Jerry Jones has repeatedly expressed public disappointment with the defense, casting doubt on the future of his hand-picked coordinator, Matt Eberflus.\n\nVikings: Kevin O’Connell’s status, of course, remains on firm ground. In other years, he’d be a Coach of the Year candidate for somehow guiding this team to a 8-8 record with injuries hitting hard at quarterback and elsewhere. The most pressing issue is defensive coordinator Brian Flores’ contract, which is set to expire after the season. The Vikings have been hopeful about working out a new deal, and when Flores last spoke to reporters this past Tuesday, he expressed his love for Minnesota.\n\nChiefs: Andy Reid confirmed this week what we previously reported: He’ll be back for 2026. But there are other questions surrounding next year’s Chiefs. With offensive coordinator Matt Nagy’s contract up, several scenarios are in play -- including Nagy getting a head coaching job. He’ll be among the top candidates, a rare one this cycle with experience and a background on offense. If he doesn’t get a head job, leaving to take over as a primary play-caller elsewhere is also possible.\n\nLions: Head coach Dan Campbell will evaluate changes as he moves into offseason mode. But the focus figures to be -- again -- on finding a new offensive coordinator. Campbell took over play-calling duties during the season from good friend John Morton, who said this week, “I’d like to be here,” which could mean staying in a diminished role. But after losing Ben Johnson to a head coaching job last year, Campbell appears set to search for a new OC again.\n\nGiants: Interim head coach Mike Kafka is expected to get an interview. Others potentially on the radar include ex-NFL head coaches Vance Joseph, Kliff Kingsbury, Mike McCarthy, Matt Nagy and Antonio Pierce; current assistants Lou Anarumo, Joe Brady, Matt Burke, Jesse Minter, Chris Shula and Davis Webb; and current head coaches that become available.\n\n\n\n",

So he just saw our friend die in front of his eyes - and that's it.\"\n\nThe matter of fact way in which Sudan forward John Mano recounts the death of his best friend Medo is at odds with the intense look burning in his eyes as he does so. \n\nMedo is one of more than 150,000 people to have been killed during the country's civil war which began in April 2023.\n\nMano, who debuted for the national team just months before the conflict started, says Medo had travelled to the city of Wadi Halfa, near the border with Egypt, to arrange documentation to leave the country during what the United Nations is calling the world's largest humanitarian crisis.\n\n\"I think they forgot some certificates,\" the 24-year-old tells BBC Sport Africa, speaking at the team's hotel at the ongoing 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Morocco.\n\n\"It was so important for the family and he had to go back. He went to his house and took everything.\n\n\"They caught him. They said, 'Are you working with the army?' He just wanted to explain. But they started shooting him.\"\n\n# 'I cannot forget this until I die'\n\nThe power struggle between Sudan's army and a paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Force (RSF), has also forced more than 12 million people to flee their homes, with widespread famine and reports of genocide in the western Darfur region.\n\nUnsurprisingly, football has taken a back seat. Stadiums have been destroyed and the league halted.\n\nTwo of the country's biggest club sides, Al Hilal and Al Merrikh, are currently playing in the Rwandan league, having spent last season in the Mauritanian top flight.\n\n\"We don't have a league, we don't have anything, but we can't complain because people in my country, they can't eat, they don't have food,\" says Mano.\n\nBut despite all the challenges - including having to play their home Afcon qualifying matches in neutral countries - [Sudan have reached the finals](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn9xpx797x5o) for only the fourth time since 1976.\n\nGhanaian head coach Kwesi Appiah has had to convince players to compete without guarantees of payment and has offered consolation on \"several occasions\" when squad members have lost family members.\n\n\"We try to let players know, even though they're gone, \\[they're\\] looking at you and what you can do now for the nation,\" says the 65-year-old, who took charge in September 2023.\n\n\"I need to give the player maybe two or three days off, to make sure he comes back to himself.\"\n\nSome of the players have not been home in years, with many lucky enough to find a new club overseas.\n\nLike several others in the Falcons of Jediane squad, Mano has made the move to Libya, first joining Al Ahly and now Al Akhdar.\n\nBut the former Al Hilal man did not escape Sudan before experiencing a death threat of his own.\n\n\"The rebels used to stop us and make fun of us on the road,\" he explains.\n\n\"They'd say things like 'You play for Al Hilal - what is Al Hilal? I support Al Merrikh. I can kill you right now and nobody will question me'.\n\n\"I cannot forget this story until I die.\"\n\nAppiah and Sudan captain Bakhit Khamis say part of their role has been creating a family feeling within the squad.\n\n\"Football is the only relief we have as Sudanese people,\" says left-back Khamis, who also currently plays in Libya.\n\n\"It is the only thing that can make us happy and help us forget the pain and suffering we \\[have been\\] through during the period of war.\n\n\"The feeling of unity becomes part of you, you cannot avoid it. Our goal has become stronger - Sudan first, Sudan above everything.\n\n\"This unity is one of the best things that has happened to us. It was able to make us united as one people.\"\n\nAppiah aims to make players feel they can be \"the best in the world\" with the right attitude, inspiring his team to a memorable home win in Libya [over Ghana](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c7813dgy0mro) \\- the country he won the 1982 Afcon with as a player and later managed twice - during their qualifying campaign.\n\nWhen an ambassadorial delegation arrived at the team hotel after the game, the squad discovered that soldiers back in Sudan were celebrating the result.\n\n\"At least for one day, they put their guns down,\" says Appiah, hoping that the war will \"cease totally\" to allow \"everybody to come back home happily\".\n\n\"I believe that, if by grace we are able to win it (Afcon), you never know.\"\n\nWhile hoping the soldiers lay down their guns permanently, Mano describes football as a \"weapon\" to \"fight for my country\".\n\nHe is promising the fans back home that the 1970 champions will battle all the way in Morocco.\n\n\"Some of them (the fans), they can't watch the match, you know that? Not even on the radio, they can't hear.\n\n\"Every day people \\[are\\] dying.\n\n\"We're trying to free our country the football way.\"\n\n[Source.](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cm2vjy3gvl1o)  \n",

This season, I say we make some noise and push Isaiah Stewart to be in the 6MOTY conversation.\n\nThe idea came to me when Stew won Eastern Conerence Defensive Player of the Month despite playing off the bench and earning just over 20 mins a game. I know that 6MOTY is almost always rewarded to subs who bring instant offensive firepower. But the prominent names in the sixth man talk right now are not really running away with it. Ajay Mitchell, Naz Reid, and Keldon Johnson are averaging just 3 to 4 ppg more than Stew. NAW's name comes up in some lists, but he has more games as a starter than a sub so he should not be considered.\n\nStew has bigger impact as a sub even if his contribution offensively is not huge. Which of the other 6MOTY candidates serve as a symbol of the identity of their teams? Cade of course is the face of our franchise, but the Pistons are currently leading the East because they are the 2nd best defensive team in the league and Stewart is the face of our defense.\n\nISAIAH STEWART FOR NBA SIXTH MAN OF THE YEAR!\n\n",

        "selftext": "I know this a half baked idea and will never happen, but there is no doubt it would make the league more entertaining. A true QB carousel. \n\nWe go back to 17 week season. Every team starts the first 8 games with their QB. Then, every team has their bye week in week 9. This is when QBs would switch. They would go into a lottery and each team from draw a name for their QB for the rest of the regular season. They would have a week and a half to learn a new playbook, team, and coaching staff. \nWhen the playoffs come along, all playoff contenders would switch again. \n\nImagine the absolute chaos. A few senecios that could happen:\n-  You’re 7-1 with Drake Maye, only to make the wildcard at 10-6 with Bryce Young. And you have half a week to get ready with Joe Burrow. \n-  You get lucky with having Mahomes and Prescott finishing with the 1 or 2 seed only to have JJ McCarthy in the playoffs\n-  You start off 2-6 with Justin Fields only to get a healthy Lamar and squeak out the division and end up with Sam Darnold. \nAll QBs would be payed by league and would not count against the salary cap, unless they’re injured. League doctors would have to say they are injured to avoid any tampering. \nTeams would have to build out solid rosters and be prepared to win with average to mediocre QBs. \nWe would no longer debate if you gave QB A the team of QB B, they would be great. Now we know who the best quarterback is, because they truly win everywhere. ",
