It might even kill the visiting team, granted the \"home\" team had the good sense to actually stay home that day.\n\nSome better analogies for a poor defender include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. An unobstructed ureter.\n2. A disenchanted high school teacher who has given up on trying to make a difference.\n3. A broken airport metal detector.\n4. Someone who doesn't understand jokes.\n5. A traffic light where all three lights are green.\n6. A poorly positioned diaphragm.\n7. A priority target for a squad of storm-troopers.\n8. A trust-based low security Danish prison.\n9. A worry-free millennial.\n10. An overactive and scientifically anomalous immune system.\n11. An inanimate carbon rod.\n12. Crotchless boxers.\n13. A Watchmojo top 10 list.\n14. People who use the term 'acronym' when it is clearly an initialism.\n15. James Harden.\n16. An understudy fluffer who's been suddenly called into active duty.\n17. Someone who always misses their flight.\n18. Flattened villi from undiagnosed celiac disease.\n19. A Ben Shapiro video essay.\n20. Someone who had love, but didn't realize it until it was too late.\n21. Someone who doesn't know what to do with their hands when having a casual in-person conversation with someone they just met at a work-mandated social gathering.\n\nSo in closing, please be more careful with your analogies, and the next time someone calls YOU a black hole on defense, take it as a compliment and offer to expertly secure their balls like every black hole would.",

So they were cunts for making the loan deal with the idea basically of just getting cheap depth for the season. \n\nLiverpool on the other hand, by demanding such a low game number for the obligation have made this a very real posibility, and frankly the fact they played him in the PL this season (thus meaning he can't transfer again this season) while clearly wanting to move him on. \n\nThat single minute they played him in... for no reason... Has basically meant if this loan didn't work, he doesn't have any options till the summer. \n\nElliott is someone whose talent I really believe in. I'd happily take him at Newcastle. I think he's got a skill set many sides are missing in the modern English game. And he's basically had a year of his career taken from him.",

Feeling on top of the world, they disrespected us by blasting highlights from the Lions’ NFC Championship loss to the Niners on the jumbotron.\n\nEver since then, I’ve been running permanent hate circles around that shit franchise. The Kings are a joke, always have been, always will be. Hope they’re enjoying whatever the hell the Westbrook–DeRozan era is supposed to be, because that’s as good as they deserve",
