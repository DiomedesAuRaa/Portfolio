        "selftext": "Manchester United’s sacking of Ruben Amorim will take their compensation bill to almost £100m since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement in 2013.\n\nAmorim is due to walk away with a £10m pay day after being dismissed on Monday with 18 months still remaining on his contract.\n\nThe 40-year-old Portuguese coach, who earned around £6.5m a year, cost United £11m to hire from Sporting in November 2024, meaning the Amorim experiment has set the club back around £28.5m in total.\n\nUnited have now spent £78m in offloading managers and their accompanying backroom staff since Ferguson retired after 27 years at the helm.\n\nRalf Rangnick was then brought in on a six-month basis with an agreement to remain as a consultant. But the Austrian left at the end of the 2021-22 season after it was decided he would not take up the consultancy role, which cost the club £14.7m.\n\nErik ten Hag seemed likely to lose his job in the wake of winning the FA Cup against Manchester City in 2024 but United ultimately ended up triggering a one-year extension in his deal only to sack him 116 days later.\n\nHis departure cost United £10.4m and now Amorim has become the latest casualty of the club’s managerial merry-go-round.\n\nIn addition to those costs, United have also forked out almost £21m bringing in managers and hiring and firing executives.\n\nUnited paid Newcastle around £3m to extract Dan Ashworth only to sack their sporting director five months later, which cost them £4.1m in compensation.\n\nMolde received a goodwill payment of around £1m when Solskjaer left the Norwegian club to become United manager, initially on an interim basis, in December 2018.\n\nAjax were paid £1.6m by United for the loss of Ten Hag and assistant Mitchell van der Gaag.\n\nUnited paid Southampton about £1m in compensation to secure the services of Jason Wilcox, initially as technical director. Wilcox is now United’s director of football.\n\nThe compensation bill paid to Sporting for Amorim remains by far the biggest hiring cost.\n\n[Source.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk)",

The players wouldn’t want to do this so they would try to win every game that they can, making games competitive for as much of the season as possible. \n\nOf course, the teams that get eliminated from playoff contention are usually the worst teams that fans don’t come to watch, but the jeans solve this. Tell me you wouldn’t go watch your team when the kings come to town in late February, and they are all stuck wearing jeans to play basketball. This is the entertainment the NBA needs, it just is!",
