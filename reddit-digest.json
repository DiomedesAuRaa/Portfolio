        "selftext": "Basically guys who are starting but have a diminished or unnatural role, or bench guys who should be starting somewhere.  I’ll give my top 3 \n\n1. Anthony black: I will never get off this hill and I’ve known it since day 1, he \\*will\\* be an all star some day whether it be in Orlando or elsewhere(I’ve been begging for the Celtics to trade for him for years).  I’m just in love with his feel for the game paired with his defensive/passing instincts and ability to stay under control.  The shooting will continue to improve and he would be the PERFECT combo guard starting next to a curry/dame/trae/white/garland type player \n\n2. Kuminga: I truly don’t care what anyone says I genuinely just think Kerr is the most stubborn coach in the league and is ruining this guy.  Reminds me a ton of young Jaylen, has all the tools and ability in the world just needs to be empowered.  Will thrive somewhere where he canstep into a 2nd/3rd option role right away(Chicago/washington/sacramento/philly).  \n\n3. Jaylin Williams: annoys me to no end that the thunder are fully aware of this but they hoard him despite that because they can.  This dude would be such a perfect Celtics center I swear to god, I just tend to buy stock in these high feel shooting bigs who defend with their brains and he fits that mold.  I think he could be a starting level big somewhere else. \n\nHonorable mention- Derek lively: doesn’t make the list because injuries have robbed him of his career lately but when healthy I still think Dallas is a bad fit for him now, he really should be the short roll/defensive anchor next to a high volume playmaker/scorer(like Luka) because that’s where he thrives.  He’s an incredible connector on both ends and truly raises the ceiling of a good offense and good defense, thrives off of someone who can do the pick and roll dance. Probably won’t ever come to fruition because of health but he’s one of my favorite players in recent history \n\nWho are your picks? ",

        "selftext": "Start stop begining to the season and even had a collapse on the floor holding his knee episode 3 or 4 weeks ago and it was for sure looking like his season was going to be barely playing and when he does he looks completely shot like he has the last 14 ish months\n\nEven when he did play and look Ok, it seemed like he didn't fit with what the Sixers were doing that was successful early in the season and it all looked lost \n\nThen the past few weeks he's suddenly playing all the time, averaging 34 minutes a game, putting up 28 points a game, moving a lot better and even threw down a dunk last night as the Sixers beat the Knicks for their 3rd straight road win. \n\nI think everyone (rightfully) wrote off Embiid and the Sixers from serious East contention, but if Embiid is actually getting healthier somehow, that's a sneaky dangerous team",

In game six of that series Embiid hyperextends his knee after he tries a put back dunk.\n\nSecond round we find our selves against the Knicks. We go down 0-2. Embiid comes back in a a brace and we somehow win two in a row. Then we split the next two. Game seven we lose by 15 in msg. Embiid has 16 points 6 rebounds. Maxey and VJ shoot 2-16 from deep. Brunson has 42 points. Mikal bridges mom continues to get revenge. \n\nIf only Embiid was healthy we would’ve made the conference finals, so we’ll try again next year where he’ll finally be healthy.",

Lower minutes, games off at any sign of discomfort, a supporting cast that doesn’t need him to play injured or risk being a lottery team. \n\nStill more realistic he gets hurt but he’s never been given this much ability to slowly, very slowly ramp into a season.",

I mean, many fans and media members didn’t think he could get back to even this level of play. He’s not as impactful on defense these days, but he still has such remarkable touch and skill. I’m happy for Joel and hope he’s able to stay healthy. I think it’s important that the entire load of the team doesn’t rely on him offensively anymore.",
