Those conference percentages were based on previous CFP appearances among member schools in each conference.\n\nThere also will no longer be performance bonuses for advancing in the field for most teams. Miami earned around $20 million for its run this season. Next year, it will be a flat number. The team at the bottom of the SEC or Big Ten standings will earn more than the top teams from other conferences that make the field. That financial layout was one point of Florida State’s lawsuit against the ACC.\n\nNotre Dame will receive more than $12 million annually, with a $6 million boost for making the field, putting its payout near the Big Ten/SEC levels in those years it earns an invite.\"",

My parents' house is three blocks from where the latest incident happened. I know that area well. My sisters would always get donuts at the donut shop on that street. My grandma's favorite Greek restaurant is on that street. It's all very close. Seeing that happen definitely takes you back. You never want to see anything like that happen. I definitely think we're too advanced as a species, just plain and simple, for things like that to be happening. No matter what your opinions are or what your beliefs are, you should be able to agree that nobody needs to be dying on the street. I wasn't there. I don't have a full picture of everything going on.
