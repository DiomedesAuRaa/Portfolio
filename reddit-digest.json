He had a son born in Detroit. \n\nHe was gifted some land on what's now Shelby Street, but then you kicked our British asses back home 😂 \n\nLearning more about your city and its history made me develop a real soft spot for the Lions. \n\nI've watched every game this season. If I’m in, I’m in properly through bad seasons as much as good ones. \n\nI played rugby in my 20s, so I’m probably wired a bit toward effort, pride, and showing up even when things aren’t going your way.\n\nHopefully a superbowl is coming soon but I'll be supporting whether you win one or not. \n\nI’ve been reading here for a bit and wanted to finally stop lurking and say hello.\n\nCheers from the UK and go Lions.

        "selftext": "The Pistons half court offense struggles so much with him on the floor, the spacing reminds me of the 14 win season. Defenses packing the paint, sagging off of Ausar and Harris, taking away the Cade/Duren lob and trapping Cade later in the game. \n\nEvery shot that he takes that isn't a wide open dunk is essentially a turnover, or he's gonna go to the line and probably miss both free throws.  Teams in the playoffs will exploit this. \n\nPersonally I almost like what I'm seeing from Ron Holland more at this point in the season. He's a great defender himself, he's not afraid to shoot the ball (even if he's not the best shooter), he's a much better shot creator, and I trust him more at the free throw line. He's gives up a bit in size but the trade off is worth it. \n\nThe Pistons might have a make a tough decision with Ausar and either move him to the bench or even test the market for him to see if they can upgrade their shooting on the perimeter.
