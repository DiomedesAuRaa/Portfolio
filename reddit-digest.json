And Los Angelenos love doing outdoorsy stuff during the day on a weekend to enjoy the weather. \n\n3. Valentine's Day. \n\nSo you essentially paid $450 for a 3 pt contest.

Especially since Ferrari publicly brought this issue to everyone’s attention a full year ago.\n\nIf they feel their cars are unsafe on the start, then they can start in the pit lane.",
