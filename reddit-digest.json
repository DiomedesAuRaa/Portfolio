Oregon State and Washington State will each receive around $3.6 million as part of an addendum signed later. Those conference percentages were based on previous CFP appearances among member schools in each conference.\n\nThere also will no longer be performance bonuses for advancing in the field for most teams. Miami earned around $20 million for its run this season. Next year, it will be a flat number. The team at the bottom of the SEC or Big Ten standings will earn more than the top teams from other conferences that make the field. That financial layout was one point of Florida State’s lawsuit against the ACC.\n\nNotre Dame will receive more than $12 million annually, with a $6 million boost for making the field, putting its payout near the Big Ten/SEC levels in those years it earns an invite.\"",

I'd love to stay in Michigan for a few days, maybe see a bit of the campus, explore Detroit a little bit (I'm also a Lions and Red Wings fan).\nI'm just looking for some advice, how expensive would it be, how realistic is the idea, are there many places to stay, is it even easy to get tickets? I've never been to the US so I have no clue about anything really.\nI know I could ask this stuff to Google but honestly I'd prefer to hear from real people!\nAny help would be appreciated!!\nThanks and Go Blue! 〽️",

When you’ve got Jalen Duren and Isaiah Stewart ahead of you, it’s easy to get lost in the rotation — but every time Reed gets minutes, he makes himself impossible to ignore.\n\nYou can honestly talk yourself into him being more than an energy big. He could start and not look out of place.\n\nHe’s not pretty. He’s not smooth.\n\nBut he does the dirty schnitzel. \n\nAlso, let’s be real — he should be like an 80 overall in 2K.\n\nBro is all Detroit. ",
