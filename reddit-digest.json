A lot of it is about a controlled way of fitting into a system.”\n\nEriksen stops short of bemoaning the revival of set pieces — he still takes all of them, after all — and insists he is not ready for a “tennis, padel, golf” type retirement just yet. He has signed for two years at Wolfsburg, with a possible World Cup in between, and has his eyes on a fairytale ending at Ajax, “the full circle” of finishing where he started, with the batteries still charged.\n\n“I felt like I was the young guy for so many years and now I’m the oldest,” Eriksen says. “Even today in training, I’m like ‘you guys are just starting out, I know what you’re about to go through’. But my body feels good. I feel fresh. Every session, every game now, it’s nice. Let’s see how far we can take it.”",

In addition to the three expected opt-outs – Derrick Moore, Jaishawn Barham and Gio El-Hadi – the Wolverines were missing only running back Justice Haynes and linebacker Ernest Hausmann ... Haynes, meanwhile, broke his foot in late October and hasn't played since, but he is expected to join his teammates before the Citrus Bowl on Wednesday.\n\n... with the tumult within the coaching staff, how were the Wolverines able to hold things together?\n\n\"I feel like you could either go one of two ways: we either stay together or break apart,\" linebacker Cole Sullivan said. \"I'm dang sure, we don't want to break apart. That was really the only choice we had. And the camaraderie we have in the locker room. We always tell each other we love each other. It's not something we just say.\"\n\n\"[Once everything with former coach Sherrone Moore] happened, it's like 'Is everything going downhill from here?\" running back Bryson Kuzdzal said. \"I think it was smart that Biff came in right away – we never really went down at all. It was close, then Biff made sure we were going in the right direction, so I don't think we fell off at all.\"\n\n\n",
