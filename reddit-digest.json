        "selftext": "The more I look at this class, the more I think Brad picks an edge in round 1. I think of the 3 biggest needs (T, C/G, DE)  only 2 of them are worth addressing with a 1st round pick (T, DE) and only 1 of them has actual 1st round talent this year. \n\nThis is a very weak tackle class. I think Lions fans are falling in love with Proctor out of Alabama. Don’t. You see the guy lead blocking on a screen pass and you think, wow he’s huge and he’s athletic. That’s all you need to start campaigning for Brad Holmes to make that guy a Lion. He’s not the player you think he is. He’s slow out of his stance, his technique as a pass blocker is bad, he’s overly reliant on his size, his feet are god awful, and he consistently gives up inside rushing lanes, which wouldn’t be such a problem but he’s not quick enough to consistently recover and put himself back in the path of the rusher.\n\nThe Utah tackles are not great prospects either. Both of them lack lower body strength and it’s very evident in one aspect of their game. Weirdly enough they’re the exact opposite of eachother. Fanu is a great run blocker, there’s plays he can body two guys at once, but he’s a horrible pass blocker. You can’t help but think god damn he’s skinny when he’s attempting to stop pass rushers. His lower body strength in pass pro is desperate. Lomu on the other hand is a poor run blocker, he doesn’t finish blocks, he plays with zero leverage and he leans into guys, he regularly gets himself tossed around. As a pass blocker he’s solid, not other worldly, but solid enough. He plays with a good base, sets an anchor and keeps his feet apart. \n\nMauigoa out of Miami will probably end up being the first tackle off the board because I don’t think he’s got as many holes in his games, he’s just not consistent yet nor would I consider him a blue chip talent. He’s solid as both a run blocker and a pass blocker but there are still inconsistencies. His base as a pass blocker can be hit or miss and he touches his heels together from time to time, and he leans allot as a run blocker..\n\nOn the other side of the ball, I think there are several edge prospects worth discussing as first round picks. 7 to be exact. I think 3 of those guys are can’t miss prospects for this class, I think 1 is a 3rd down specialist that offers more upside on a limited snap count than any of the tackles offer playing a full game, and I think the other 3 prospects are solid. \n\n",

This completely discredits the moronic meme that 'everything has to be perfect' for Goff to succeed.\n\nIn fact, even 5 as misleading, as Caleb Williams's and (rookie) Cam Ward's pressure rates are the product of them holding onto the ball too long, not just OL play. Goff probably had the third worst pass protection in the league. \n\nBy the way look at your beloved Stafford, Goff haters. Goff was pressured 31.7% more (5.8 percentage points\\*).\n\nI wonder how Goff would've done with Stafford's pressure rate? I wonder how Stafford would've done with Goff's pressure rate? Would Stafford have had an MVP season playing for Detroit this year? Would he have done as well as Goff did?\n\n\\* Percentage points differences are different than percentages, go back to high school stats if you don't understand this. Goff was pressured 24.1% versus 18.3% for Stafford. So Goff was pressured 31.7% (5.8/24.1) more, a massive difference.",

Defensively we have 5 pro bowlers that we need playing at form. Campbell, Hutchison, Kirby, BB, and Alim. We have to expect these 5 to get back to how they were playing in early 24 when they were healthy, aside from that I trust Amik, Barnes, Muhammad, Williams will be ok. Aside from that we have opportunities to improve this defense at corner, defensive tackle and rotational edge rushers. The biggest things the defense needs to a good pass rush up the middle, unpredictable blitzes (Aaron Glenn did this) and a more aggressive approach to playing the ball and going for the pick (this is where we miss Kirby. The other coaching critique is we need to know the type of game we are playing (less punts against the Rams in a shootout, more punts in Philly when both offenses are struggling. I didn’t put special teams stats, but that looked bad this year too. We need to draft depth, no more trading up for project players please. Other than that, in Brad we trust.

He's a great defender himself, he's not afraid to shoot the ball (even if he's not the best shooter), he's a much better shot creator, and I trust him more at the free throw line. He's gives up a bit in size but the trade off is worth it. \n\nThe Pistons might have a make a tough decision with Ausar and either move him to the bench or even test the market for him to see if they can upgrade their shooting on the perimeter.
