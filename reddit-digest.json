The agreement was signed by Dr. David Cook and me, reflecting shared leadership and continuity as the university moves forward during this transition. This decision follows extensive evaluation and discussion and represents a long term strategy aligned with NDSU’s mission as a student focused, land grant, research university.\n\n \n\nThis move represents the next step in a decade of competitive excellence and careful planning. Athletics visibility is one important part of this transition, but it is not the sole driver. Conference alignment at the FBS level supports broader goals related to enrollment, academic reputation, research partnerships, workforce alignment, and national engagement, while maintaining our commitment to affordability, access, and student success.\n\n \n\nUpdates will continue to be shared as implementation planning progresses.\n\n \n\nThank you for your leadership, care for students and colleagues, and commitment to NDSU. This moment reflects what our people have built together and positions the university to move forward with purpose, collaboration, and confidence.\n\n \n\nGo Bison,\n\n \n\n \n\nRick Berg\n\nInterim President / Office of the President\n\nNORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY",

        "selftext": "Original article: https://ericmintzer.substack.com/p/giannis-kalshi-and-the-death-of-trust\n\n\\> In the week leading up to the NBA trade deadline, Shams reported Giannis Antetokounmpo wanted out of Milwaukee. ESPN promptly named the Miami Heat, New York Knicks, Minnesota Timberwolves, and Golden State Warriors as potential landing spots. Over the next several days, Giannis trade rumors took over the sports news cycle. Major outlets discussed it seriously, debated fits, and framed it as a real possibility. Yet, as the deadline passed, the two-time MVP remained with the Bucks.\n\n\\> Soon after, Giannis announced that he had taken a partial ownership stake in Kalshi, a prediction-market platform that allows users to bet on real-world outcomes. Kalshi hosts prediction markets on sports, politics, and pretty much anything, even the weather. In the weeks leading up to the deadline, roughly $23 million had been placed on Kalshi markets tied to where Giannis would end up.\n\n\\> The situation presents a clear conflict of interest. Giannis publicly allowed trade speculation to build, and millions of dollars flowed into markets, guessing where he might go. When the deadline passed, he stayed in Milwaukee and also held a partial ownership stake in the platform that hosted those bets. Even without proof of intent, the overlap is hard to ignore. Kalshi’s markets visibly shifted in response to news updates and reporting about Giannis throughout the process.\n\n\\> This concern is not theoretical. Over the past year, gambling scandals have erupted across major sports. In the NBA, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups were arrested in an FBI investigation into illegal sports betting schemes involving organized crime. Yes, that Mafia. In college basketball, federal authorities have revealed widespread point-shaving and match-fixing investigations. The scandal involved 39 players and 17 teams. In Major League Baseball, Cleveland Guardians pitcher Emmanuel Clase was federally indicted on charges including wire fraud, bribery, and conspiracy for allegedly rigging pitches in as many as 48 games.\n\n\\> If we can’t trust the news, the markets, or the motives behind the stories we follow, then what are we actually watching? Sports only work if we believe they are real. Giannis did more than test that belief. He broke it. By tying trade speculation to ownership in a prediction market, he crossed a line that sports have treated as a cardinal sin for generations. It dealt a direct blow to fan trust and to the league’s claim of integrity.\n\n\\> Once fans start asking whether outcomes, stories, and speculation are part of the show, the illusion is already gone. Gambling did not blur the line between performance and reality by accident. It made the blur profitable. And once uncertainty itself becomes the product, trust is no longer the foundation of sports. It becomes the wager.",

Nothing. He walked past them, as our people say – as if past a Turkish cemetery. With a single wave of the hand, without looking, like when he assists his teammates, which the greatest optimists interpreted as a greeting…  \n  \n>And they were waiting, all dressed up, neatly prepared, in traditional costumes that they had carefully prepared, washed, and repaired days in advance especially for this occasion.  \n  \n>And in the end they returned home sad, deprived of a memory they would have cherished for the rest of their lives – to meet a brilliant basketball player, their countryman, whom they admire and for whom they cheer with all their hearts.  \n  \n>Luckily, they were already old enough, so they did not really cry or shed tears, which did happen last year, in the same place, on the same occasion…  \n  \n>Namely, back then, also after a Denver–Chicago game, more than 300 of our children, little ones, waited for over an hour in the arena corridor to meet the MVP, the best in the world. In vain.  \n  \n>Nikola Jokić did not deem it worthy to dedicate five minutes of his time to them.  \n  \n>In the end, another great basketball player, but also a great man, Nikola Vučević, appeared and comforted them, even though he does not play for the Serbian but for the Montenegrin national team.  \n  \n>He came out of the locker room and kindly posed with the children, tossed them some “bones,” talked with them and their parents…\n\nFull article: [https://serbiantimes.info/en/column-kovacevic-nikola-jokic-childrens-tears-and-the-difference-between-a-great-basketball-player-and-a-great-man-video/](https://serbiantimes.info/en/column-kovacevic-nikola-jokic-childrens-tears-and-the-difference-between-a-great-basketball-player-and-a-great-man-video/)",

I have to keep going because this is what everyone deserves and expects.”\n\nUntil this year, Haaland’s most demanding season was his first at City — the Treble-winning campaign of 2022-23 — when, including appearances for Norway, he played 4,483 minutes. However, he refuses to blame tiredness for his slump.\n\n“I don’t want to speak about why I haven’t performed. I don’t think there’s any excuse,” he said.\n\n“Fatigue is in the head. It’s a lot of games. Look at the schedule, it’s not easy, and for me, it’s about staying fit, don’t get injured. That’s the most important thing. And try to be ready to help the team.”\n\n",
