        "selftext": "Okay so earlier this year when Johnny Mo came on he said he wanted to...\n\n\"Hunt for explosives\"\n\nMo is from the school of the Air Coryell system.  It uses geometry to stretch the field wide and deep.\n\nThe issue, to get those chunk plays you need to hold the ball longer.\n\nThis season Lions rank #1 in 40+ yard completions.\n\nThe Ben Johnson likes the Erhart-Perkins system.\n\nThis system is based around simplicity.  Where the play call is very short, and the players run the same route just from different formations.\n\nIt resulted in short to mid range plays.\n\nThe data reveals what happened.\n\n2024 Lions - \nAverage depth to target 7.1 yards.\nAverage depth to target 3rd down 7.4\n\nGoff's pocket time was 2.3s\nPressure to sack 18.2%\nEPA + 0.22\n\nShift to this year\n\n2025 Lions - \n\nAverage depth to target 6.8\nAverage depth to target 3rd down 9.6\n\nGoff's pocket time was 2.6s\nPressure to sack 23.9%\nEPA + 0.18\n\nWhat all this means is, when Goff was throwing, he had to hold onto the ball longer, to allow plays to develop.  The system is reliant on deep routes to stretch the field.\n\nObviously with an interior offensive line made of rookies, 3rd stringers and a journeyman this was a storm waiting to happen.\n\nOne wrinkle to is average sack depth.\n\n2024 - 6.5\n2025 - 7.6\n\nChasing explosives put Goff in a position where he had to do more 7 step drops.  This forced a young offensive line to hold on for longer.\n\nAgain it worked against the personnel we had.  Getting the ball out quick isn't part of this scheme.\n\nAnother interesting thing, that I noticed was rhythm...\n\nLast year it felt like they'd get into a rhythm, which is a halmark of the Erhart-Perkins system.  Shorter plays to get yards to get the team in a rhythm.\n\nWhere this year if we got disrupted chasing chunk plays, we got behind in the count and things became disjointed.\n\nI'm still learning about football and these concepts...\n\nBut it's an interesting look at a few things I felt were off, but couldn't put a finger on it.\n\nEDIT: Added the part about sacks, and updated the average yards per attempt and 3rd down.\n",
