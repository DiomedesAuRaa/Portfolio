An autopsy is scheduled for Sunday, and the police department is currently investigating the death.\n\nMoore, who starred as a college receiver at Purdue, was drafted in the second round of the 2021 NFL Draft by the Arizona Cardinals. He played three years with the Cardinals before multiple serious knee injuries derailed his career.\n\nHe signed with the Vikings before the 2025 season. In the team’s first preseason game, he tore his ACL. He was not around the facility throughout the season after being placed on injured reserve.\n\n“Rondale Moore was a complete joy to coach,” his college coach, Jeff Brohm, wrote in a statement. “The ultimate competitor that wouldn’t back down from any challenge. Rondale has a work ethic that was unmatched by anyone. A great teammate that would come through in any situation. We all loved Rondale, we loved his smile and competitive edge that always wanted to please everyone he came in contact with. We offer all of our thoughts and prayers to Rondale and his family, we love him very much!!!” \n",

He was on the broadcast for something unrelated (an honors night or something) and honestly, when talk pivoted to the current Pistons, he sounded like a guy in his mid-70s who wasn’t keeping close tabs on the team anymore and was trying to feel his way through based on what he’d gleaned from the periphery. \n\nFrom how it sounded, he was trying to riff a little and failed, which can happen when a topic is sprung on you when you’re guesting on a live broadcast. \n\nMoreover, he clarified his remarks after the uproar and it felt very clear that he meant no disrespect. \n\nPeople make mistakes sometimes, and they misspeak and say things that are wrong. But continuing to beat a fellow Pistons legend over the head about this just isn’t it, in my opinion.\n\n**Edit:** [Bing’s clarifying remarks like a day or two after:](https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nba/pistons/2022/03/16/detroit-pistons-cade-cunningham-dave-bing-comments-nba/7055316001/)\n\n> \"Cade is a hell of a player,\" Bing said. \"He’s going to be an All-Star for years to come. I think he should be Rookie of the Year. He’s unique in that he really doesn’t have many weaknesses. Here’s a guy who consistently will get 20 points a game, six or seven rebounds a game, five or six assists a game. There are not many players in the NBA that can do that, and he’s doing that as a rookie. I think he has a very bright future, and I surely wish him the best of luck because now, as he’s growing, this organization is going to do well by drafting him No. 1.\"",
