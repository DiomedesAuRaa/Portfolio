        "selftext": "Record-wise, this season was the best Georgia Tech has had since 2014. But this season ended on a very rough stretch. Tech rambled and wrecked their way through a favorable schedule with an 8-0 start, including a win over Clemson when people thought they were still good, and reached as high as #7 in the AP poll. Yet there were shaky games and signs of concern cropping up. Sloppy wins over Wake Forest and Duke were the first alarm flags on a storm brewing in Raleigh that would begin the terrible slide. NC State haded Tech their first loss of the season was the first domino on the road to 1-4. The one win was a 2-point win over a Boston College team that finished 2-10. They had a multi-week stretch in which their defense was among the worst in the country and when they finally got it fixed against Georgia, their offense was completely stifled and held without a touchdown for the first time all season, and just the third time in the Brent Key era (second in the full-time era). It was Georgia's 8th straight win over Tech, tying the record for most consecutive wins in the series, a record Tech held for almost 70 years despite Georgia's Sisyphean quest to take it for themselves.\n\nBut wait, the Georgia game isn't a conference game, so they still went to Charlotte with a chance to win their way into the playoff via the conference champion auto-bid slot, right? Wrong! Tech was among the group of ACC teams with 2 conference losses that somehow ended up behind Duke due to the asinine tie-breakers the ACC has. Instead, they had to sit at home as Duke dookied all over the ACC's playoff hopes (save for the committee jumping Miami in at the buzzer) and their arch-rival get over their Alabama hump in emphatic fashion to lock up their 2nd straight SEC title, 3rd in the last 4 years, second straight top 4 seed in the 12 team playoff and their 4th playoff appearance in the last 5 years. Oh and they had to watch their star offensive coordinator, most of his staff, and their heir-apparent QB\\* jump ship to Florida (\\*Aaron Philo has not committed to Florida at the time of this writing but I mean come on).\n\nBut at least Notre Dame pitched a hissy fit about not getting into the playoff and they got to go to the best bowl game around in the Pop Tarts Bowl instead of the Irish. And even without their OC they were doing good! Tech had an 11-point lead with as much as 11:13 left in the game. But this is an Atlanta-based football team we're talking about here. BYU held Tech scoreless in the second half and managed to take the lead with 2 minutes to go. But Tech had 2 minutes and all 3 timeouts left to try to save the win. They would manage to get all the way to the BYU 18 with 50 seconds and all 3 of those timeouts. Engineers at heart, though, rather than try to methodically cover the final 18 yards they needed, they decided to just power through logic and force the issue with 4 straight passes to the end zone. None worked, and Haynes King's final pass as a Jacket was intercepted in the end zone to give all the Pop Tarts to the Stormin' Mormons. Well all except Slammin' Strawberry who ran from Pop Tart heaven at the last second.\n\nSo it's certainly a disappointing way to end what once looked like a very promising season for the North Avenue Trade School. And now one has to question where they go from here. In the personal opinion of this writer, Brent Key is a great coach who fits in wonderfully at Tech and he has already had more success on the flats than anyone else has in the last 10 years, certainly more than the last guy. They have a good culture down there in Midtown and they can be set up for success. But success is relative, and to be fair to Tech, the expectations are not what they are at other programs. Would I bet on Brent Key's Jackets to win a national championship? No, but I do think he's capable of consistent 8-win seasons, beating Georgia occasionally (admittedly he should have already gotten 1 win), and competing for ACC titles. But only time will tell if the hope of that future can outweigh the sour taste of what could have been that the end of this season has to have left in the mouths of every Tech fan...\n\n...Or is that just their clear whiskey and 3,000 pound barrel of rum and sugar they're pounding down there at Johnny's Hideaway?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1pywyri/ranking_the_mlb_teams_according_to_how_likely_it/",
        "selftext": "Hello and happy holidays to everyone on r/baseball. I hope you and your loved ones all had a wholesome and very merry Christmas. Now let's talk about freaky sex.\n\nThis is a ranking of how likely it is that a team name might be spoken, shouted, moaned, whispered, or otherwise vocalized during a sexual interaction. For the purposes of this list, \"sex\" includes everything that might possibly fall under a very broad umbrella of sexual interactions which I am not going to attempt to circumscribe or define here, EXCEPT to note that post-coital intimacy is explicitly not included -- otherwise, statements such as \"do you think the Brewers game is still on?\" would be in play.\n\nFor the purposes of these rankings, I am using the team's official name in its entirety as stated on [mlb.com](http://mlb.com/), and no short versions or nicknames. This means we are only considering the Blue Jays and not the \"Jays\" or (so help me) \"BJs.\" And before Toronto fans complain too much, please understand that otherwise the A's and O's would absolutely run away with this one.\n\nHowever, I am allowing both the singular (\"f\\*\\*k me like a Brewer!\") and the plural (\"this is even better than when that group of Brewers f\\*\\*ked me last night!\"). And since we are only considering the spoken word I am allowing homophones as well, which should come as a delight to the small-but-vocal segment of Philadelphia fans who are weirdly insistent that their team is named after young female horses.\n\nRelatedly, I am allowing situations where the team name is said as part of a larger word or phrase. Which is potentially important news for anyone who spontaneously sings \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" at the moment of climax, but probably more important for teams such as the Astros and Reds.\n\nAs always, these rankings are just for fun, and in no way reflect my feelings vis-a-vis these teams, their players, their ownership, or their fans. Nor do these rankings necessarily reflect my sexual interests, proclivities, or experiences as a cisgendered heterosexual man. If you feel I am overlooking a situation feel free to note it in the comments, but for the love of God please do NOT share your personal sexual anecdotes here. This is not r/Economics.\n\nSince a disappointing number of you never bothers to read these rules anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and wrap up the foreplay and get on with the action.\n\n**Tier One -- Perhaps As a Safety Word**\n\n**30: Arizona Diamondbacks**\n\n**29: Washington Nationals**\n\n**28: Toronto Blue Jays**\n\n**27: Baltimore Orioles** \\-- The ranking of these four is more or less arbitrary, but for what it's worth I think \"Oriole\" would make a great safety word. And for a variety of reasons which I will not describe in detail, it is better if a safety word is not too long and does not include any sounds such as \"b\" or \"t\" which might require you to be able to close your mouth or bring your teeth together.\n\n**Tier Two --** ***Les Adjectifs de L'Amour***\n\n**26: Los Angeles Dodgers** \\-- Look, this is a judgment-free zone. Sometimes discretion is the better part of valor.\n\n**25: Atlanta Braves** \\-- \"It was so brave of you not to say 'oriole' when I \\[\\*\\*\\*\\*\\] that \\[\\*\\*\\*\\*\\] in your \\[\\*\\*\\*\\*\\].\"\n\n**24:** (I'm still calling them the Oakland) **Athletics** \\-- Several possibilities here, including commentary on how athletic one might be in dodging that object or substance.\n\n**Tier Three -- There's No Wrong Way to Roleplay, But ...**\n\n**23: Milwaukee Brewers** \\-- Presuming that you are not having sex with Brewer Hicklen.\n\n**22: Texas Rangers** \\-- Cowboys/cowgirls/cow-nonbinaries are a fairly common fantasy. Maybe people fantasize about rangers as well, but it seems rather less likely to me.\n\n**21: Seattle Mariners** \\-- I won't argue much if you think the Rangers and Mariners should switch spots. But just think of the possibilities if MLB had had the good sense to name the team the \"Seattle Sailors\" instead.\n\n**20: Cleveland Guardians** \\-- Numbers 21-23 represent unusual but otherwise fine forms of roleplay. This one represents a much different form of problematic roleplay. And that's all we need to say about that.\n\n**Tier Four -- Where Should I Insert This** (Giggity)\n\n**19: Kansas City Royals** \\-- The Royals juuuuuust fall out of the weird-roleplay group. If they were named the Kings, fuhgettaboutit, right up to the front of the line. But does anyone call anyone else \"royal\" during sex? \"Oh baby, you do that so royally\" -- just doesn't sound right. But \"royal\" just happens to have a vowel combination that sounds like something someone might moan. (Go ahead, give it a try, just double-check that no one's within earshot first). So between that and however likely it might be that someone might like to be called Royal Something-or-other during sex, I'm putting it here.\n\n**18: New York Mets** \\-- No one is likely to say \"met\" as such during sex; but consider all the other things they might say: \"Oh my God, I'm so glad I met you in this Denny's restroom!\" \"No, not the furry ones, the metal ones!\" So on and so forth.\n\n**Tier Five -- The Sexual Dynamics of Hosiery**\n\n**17: Boston Red Sox** \\-- \"Oh yeah, Tina, you look so hot in those red socks.\"\n\n**16: Chicago White Sox** \\-- \"For God's sake, Allen, I'm not doing this if you don't at least take off those white socks.\"\n\n**Tier Six -- Sexy Nicknames**\n\n**15: Chicago Cubs** \\-- I'm just going to assume that there is a subset of the gay community for which this term is applied. Or failing that, perhaps someone with a speech impediment might say \"I'm gonna cub!\" \n\n**14: New York Yankees** \\-- Without delving unnecessarily into personal anecdotes, I will just say from personal experience that if you happen to be from anywhere geographically or culturally north of the Mason-Dixon Line and you share an intimate moment with someone from the other side of said line, there's a decent chance that you will hear this. Most likely being shouted at you, with a few vulgarities sprinkled in.\n\n**13: Philadelphia Phillies** \\-- A good one to come back with right after she calls you a damn dirty Yankee.\n\n**12: Detroit Tigers** \\-- Now we're drawing blood.\n\n**Tier Seven -- Roleplaying of the Less Esoteric and/or Horrifying Kind**\n\n**11: Pittsburgh Pirates** \\-- Yar, here comes me plank to shiver yer timbers and take that booty! Those of you who enjoy a jolly roger know who you are.\n\n**10: St. Louis Cardinals**\n\n**9: San Diego Padres** \\-- Religion is a common fetish, and nuns and priests are very commonly sexualized and feature in the fantasies of many a current or former Catholic. \"Padre\" seems rather more likely than \"cardinal,\" but the latter cannot be entirely ruled out. And no, I'm not going to consider any other possible sexual situations for either of these team names.\n\n**Tier Eight -- Regular-Ass People's Names**\n\n**8: Miami Marlins**\n\n**7: Tampa Bay Rays**\n\n**6: Colorado Rockies** \\-- Mostly a yawn here, but an inarguably common yawn, as saying someone's name during sex is both frequent and a good way to start a fight if said name is not accurate. But to paraphrase *When Harry Met Sally*, who's having good sex with someone named \"Ray\" or \"Marlin\"? \"Do me, Marlin.\" \"Slap my ass, Ray.\" \"I wish you'd stop saying 'oriole' so quickly, Marlin.\" No offense to anyone named Ray or Marlin. At least \"Rocky\" might be part of a boxing fantasy or something.\n\n**Tier Nine -- A Hodgepodge of Specific (But Foreseeable) Situations**\n\n**5: Minnesota Twins** \\-- \"So I was thinking \\*pant\\* that maybe one time \\*pant\\* we could do this with you and your twin...\" \"Shut up, Allen.\" \n\n**4: Houston Astros** \\-- This is the most important case for my \"it can be a part of a larger word or phrase\" rule, as \"astro\" just happens to be the prefix of a very popular brand of personal lubricant. And also maybe someone wants to engage in a little *Jetsons* roleplay. Ruh-roh.\n\n**3: San Francisco Giants** \\-- Oh, settle down. Lots of things can be giant in the bedroom. \"I'm trying to switch positions, but I can't because of your giant body pillow!\" \"You have a giant blackhead on your back!\" So on and so forth.\n\n**2: Cincinnati Reds** \\-- Much like the Giants, \"red\" can describe a lot of things, from Tina's red socks, to Allen's red pillowcase, to spanking Naomi's ass red, to Jorge shouting \"oriole\" before his ass gets any redder.\n\n**Tier Ten -- It Was Always Going to be the Angels**\n\n**1: The Angels of Whatever Place They Are From Now** \\-- I honestly tried to think of a more creative winner for these rankings, but much like Andrelton Simmons in his prime, \"angel\" just covers too much territory for anything to sneak by. It can be a man's name. It can be a woman's name. It can be a nickname. It can be a roleplaying fantasy. You might ask your partner to move their angel doll out of the way. It could even be a safe word if for some reason \"oriole\" hasn't yet occurred to you.\n\nAnd thus the Angels win their [second consecutive MLB ranking](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1ptadsd/ranking_the_mlb_teams_according_to_how_difficult/), thereby conclusively demonstrating that the league's competitive safeguards are nonfunctional and baseball is ruined. See you all in 2026.",

Kawhi reminded us old guys he's a HOFer and showed the young guys.\n\nWhat gets me is when he was just lighting up Tobias for the whole first half where was the adjustment?\n\nDid the Pistons double team him to get the ball out of his hands? No.  \nDid they sub Tobias out for younger more athletic guys like Ron or Ausar? No.  \n  \nNope they let him just blow up.   \n  \nBut surely in the second half there would be a change of some kind right? No. Tobias was on him.  \n  \nWhen did they double team him? In the 4th quarter when they were down 14!  \n  \nCuz I guess it was okay to lose the game but they didn't want him to get the all time single game scoring record?   \n\nI'm not saying the double team would have changed much. But here's what I do know.\n\nWhen any great player comes out hot you've got to try and stop him right away! Because when he sees that ball go in 3-4 times! He's feeling confident!\n\nNope Pistons let him get 40 before they doubled.  \n\nTo me that's crazy! Like I said probably a loss anyway. But when you look at that lineup, who besides a Hot Kawhi are you afraid of? Double Kawhi, keep someone on the Beard and let 97 year old Brooke Lopez try to beat you! \n\nThey doubled Cade, slowed him down. \n\nMy 2 cents. Am I crazy? ",
