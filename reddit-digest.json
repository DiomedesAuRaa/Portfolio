Entered the playoffs cold and lost in the Wild Card round.\n\n• **2024 Pittsburgh Steelers**  \nFinished 10-7 but dropped their last four games. Several outlets noted they were only the third team in NFL history to enter the playoffs on a four-game losing streak.\n\n• **1986 New York Jets** (a little different but worth mentioning)  \nThey lost five straight to end the season, still made the playoffs, and actually won their Wild Card game before losing the next round.\n\nSo if the Packers lose this Vikings game and head into the playoffs on a four-game skid, they would be joining a list that is basically two teams long, or three if you include the Jets with the longer streak.",

        "selftext": "LOS ANGELES -- After the Detroit Pistons turned what had been a tight game for most of Tuesday night into a 128-106 rout, Los Angeles Lakers coach JJ Redick admitted the officiating affected his team.\n\n\"I think there's probably a level of frustration when you're turning the ball over and you're feeling like you're getting fouled,\" Redick said. \"There's frustration there, for sure. But I mean, again, I said it even here, we said it this morning: They're going to foul every possession. It's just, you got to play through it.\"\n\nIndeed, before the game, in which the Pistons forced 21 turnovers resulting in 30 points, Redick predicted their approach.\n\n\"They're going to foul on every possession, probably three or four times,\" Redick said during his pregame remarks to reporters. \"And that's not a knock, I'm not saying it in a negative way, but they're going to foul three or four times on every possession. \\[And the officials are\\] not going to call a foul on every possession.\"\n\nDetroit was called for 26 fouls, and L.A. shot 31 free throws. The Lakers were called for 24 fouls, and the Pistons shot 29 free throws.\n\nLuka Doncic, who had a team-worst eight turnovers, said L.A. needed to up its aggression because of how the game was being officiated.\n\n\"We've got to definitely match their physicality,\" Doncic said. \"That's the whole point. We got to match how they play. You saw the refs let it go, so we should play \\[with\\] physicality, for sure.\"\n\nThe Pistons certainly let their presence be known in L.A. to finish out their five-game road trip. Lakers guard Marcus Smart took a shot to the face in the first quarter by Pistons forward Duncan Robinson and was called for a technical foul for arguing with the referee because it was not reviewed to see whether it was a flagrant foul.\n\nIn the second quarter, Lakers forward Jake LaRavia took an elbow to the side of the head from Detroit center Jalen Duren that was initially called a common foul and then upgraded to a Flagrant 1 upon review.\n\nAnd in the third quarter, Doncic was called for a technical foul for \"flailing\" after his arm hit Detroit's Ronald Holland II in the face when the two got tangled up.\n\nLate in the fourth quarter, with the Pistons' lead insurmountable, Smart stood up from his seat at the end of the bench to yell at an official for what he perceived to be continued missed calls.\n\nThe loss dropped L.A. to 20-11 -- with all 11 of those losses coming by double digits, and six by 20 or more.\n\nSource: [www.espn.com/nba/story/\\_/id/47461022/jj-redick-says-officiating-affected-lakers-loss-pistons](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/47461022/jj-redick-says-officiating-affected-lakers-loss-pistons)",
