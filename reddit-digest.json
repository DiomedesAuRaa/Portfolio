        "selftext": "[This season](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/s/51pSmGZcU1), Mendoza threw for 41 TD’s, for an average of about 2.56 per game. If you adjust this average to just 2 per game, he goes from 41 TD’s to 32 across his 16-game season. I’ll be generous and give him 35.\n\nNow let’s adjust his passer rating. **It goes from 182.9 to 177.69 just from adjusting his touchdowns to slightly above 2 per game. Later on, I will adjust further to take yards into account.**\n\nNext, we have to account for his passing yards per attempt being higher than average. He has an average of a flukey 9.3 yards per attempt this season. If we adjust this to 8 ypa, which is still 0.9 yards higher than the mean, he goes from have 3,535 passing yards to just 3,032 passing yards on the season.\n\nNow, I will adjust his passer rating again based on these newly adjusted stats.\n\nAfter this, his passer rating ends up at 166.54.\n\nHis final 16-games adjusted stats:\n\n• **3,032 yards / 379 attempts / 273 completions / 72% completion (same) / 35 touchdowns / 6 INT (same) / 8 Y/A / 166.54 rate**\n\n# What does this tell us?\n\nIt tells us that Mendoza’s perceived success in college is largely inflated by unsustainable, wildly outlier stats in his 16 games as perceived elite talent. When you adjust by bringing down his outlier stats, he heavily regresses to a slightly above average college QB.",

        "selftext": "Hello reddit,\n\n \n\nIm writing this post about the NBA “star player”, Allen Iverson. \n\nOn the 22nd of January 2026, Alllen iverson came to Cavalo Prestige Melbourne to meet 12 kids who are battling cancer. \n\nThe experience was organised by Challenge - Supporting kids with cancer, and Allen Iversons management team. \n\nMy little brother who is 12 years old and is currently receiving chemotherapy for ALCL lymphoma, was so excited to meet one of his idols.\n\nHe came out to be extremely disgusted and disappointed in Allen Iversons behaviour, and so were the other familys. \n\nFirstly, we were all told we would get to sit with him from 10:45-11:30am, and that did not happen. \n\nHe was in the podcast room until about 12:30pm and did not come out and apologise, instead his security did. \n\nWe were waiting in a downstairs room with his security with all of the kids, and his security told us he was “having a bad day” and didnt want to come out. \n\nShortly after, we were told to go upstairs to meet him, and we did not get to meet him. \n\nHe refused to allow parents in the room with him, which quite frankly is weird. \n\nOnce we were directed upstairs, we were escorted to the side of the room while he was doing a news interview. \n\nWe went into the day being told we were going to get balls/jerseys and anything else we wanted signed and to think of questions we wanted to ask him. That did not happen.\n\nAfter we waited hours, his security firmly told us he is not signing anything at all, and we did not get to talk to him at all, he did not say a word to anyone. \n\nWe were lined up and all the kids got was a photo, and he did not seem impressed about that. \n\nHe had his hands in his pockets and did not smile or put his arm around any kids in any photos. \n\nHe knew the kids were sick, and still did not put any effort or acknowledgement to that. \n\nEveryone was so disgusted in his behaviour, it was honestly so disappointing. \n\nOne of the familys drove 6 and a half hours to meet him, and the kids where so extremely sad in the end. He seemed to think he was better than everyone else, and it was obvious he did not want to have anything to do with a group of sick kids. \n\nAs parents and siblings of children with life threatening diseases, we are deeply disappointed in Allen Iversons actions and he needs to do better.",

Has me reflecting on this rivalry. I grew up in the Lansing area so I was always surrounded by the rivalry - everyone I knew had some connection to MSU. My parents went to MSU, though my mom did grad at umich when I was young so I always supported Michigan and ended up going to Michigan. I noticed pretty quickly a lot of my out of state friends didn’t really view the rivalry the same at all which is understandable. Obviously it’s MSU’s main rivalry so growing up around MSU it felt all encompassing. The rivalry used to be fun, I mean it was tense and there was plenty of shit talking and all that but it was fun. Seemed to really shift around the late 2010s, the Devin Bush stomping was a big flash point  and culminated to the point of no return with the tunnel jumping. Now it’s so divisive and toxic I hardly enjoy it anymore. Feels like fans have lost the plot a bit and they have real life hatred towards each other. I know every school has a segment of crazed fans but you’d think Michigan personally harmed a lot of Spartan fans, they legit hate Michigan more than they love their own team. \n\nTLDR- what are your thoughts on the Michigan/ MSU rivalry? Feels really toxic which drains a lot of the fun out of it for me. ",

But it goes way farther back than that.  They will never like that OSU is our main rival, when MSU considers us their main rival.\n\nIt's exactly like Texas/Oklahoma/A&M.  I live in Texas and A&M is seen as Sparty, good at everything but they aren't the main school.  That would be Texas.  Then you add that most Texas fans see Oklahoma as their main rival, out of state, and it pisses off A&M so much.

I started with a bracelet and I am trying to trade up to eventually get a $120,000 donation to the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration, which is roughly the cost to care for a loved one with FTD in a year. I am looking to trade this jersey for another item of potentially similar or greater value. I am doing this to help raise awareness for frontotemporal dementia. my dad passed away from FTD when I was 14 years old he had a genetic variant of the C9 gene which causes FTD or ALS. My goal in this project is not only to raise funding and awareness but connect with others who are impacted by dementia, grief, loss or genetic illnesses along the way. Let me know if you have something you want to trade!",
