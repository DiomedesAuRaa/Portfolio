        "selftext": "Oliver Glasner has conceded that Marc Guéhi will leave Crystal Palace for Manchester City this month for the right price.\n\nCity are considering a move for Guéhi, the 25-year-old England centre back, after their defence was weakened by injuries to Josko Gvardiol and Rúben Dias last weekend. Guéhi, whose Palace contract ends this summer, has also been linked with Liverpool, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.\n\nGlasner said last month that he expected Guéhi to stay at Palace until the end of this season, but admitted on Tuesday that he could leave in the January window.  \n\n“If a player feels too good for a club, it is better to sell him, and if a player is not good enough for a club, you also have to sell him,” Glasner said. “To get the best out of your squad, it must be a match.”\n\nAsked whether Guéhi and City are a potential “match” in January, Glasner said: “It could be. I’m not so naive as not to know that if a massive offer comes from City and Marc wants to do it, it will happen.”\n\n“Nothing in life is one-dimensional,” Glasner said. “Let’s say you have a nice car but you need money because it’s cold and a window [at home] is broken, and somebody offers you crazy money for your car. You say, ‘No, I don’t want to sell my car. I love my car. But I don’t want to freeze.’ Then you say, ‘If I can get the window and even a new roof, you can have the car. But I would like to keep it.’\n\n“It’s the same with Marc. Everybody wants him to play for Crystal Palace, sign a new contract and stay here for ever.”\n\n“On the other side, the contract ends this summer and if somebody is coming and you are freezing, there will be a moment when the club says, ‘Now the financial issue is more important than the sporting issue and we have to do it.”\n\n“There will be a threshold where if Marc says he wants to leave and the money is above the threshold, it will happen.”\n\n“The money was not above the threshold,” he said of Guéhi’s collapsed move to Liverpool. “Maybe it was close. If somebody had offered £80million for Marc and Marc said he wanted to go, then Marc wouldn’t be a Crystal Palace player.”",

        "selftext": "This Demond Williams situation at Washington feels different from a routine transfer portal entry and is worth watching closely as it changes by the minute. Williams entered the portal with a do-not-contact designation shortly (he’s going to LSU, **allegedly** for $6 M’s) after reports that he had agreed to a new NIL/rev share arrangement to stay at Washington. Washington’s response has been notable: there are indications they believe Williams is bound by that agreement and may try to enforce it. That kind of language is rare in portal situations and suggests this is moving beyond recruiting frustration into potential legal territory.\n\nWhat makes this significant is the broader NIL/rev share implications. If a school or collective attempts to hold a player to an NIL contract after he enters the portal, it challenges the assumption that NIL deals exist independently from transfer freedom. This would test whether NIL agreements can function like binding employment-style contracts, even though players are not technically classified as employees. How this is handled could affect how future NIL deals are written and how much leverage players and schools actually have.\n\nThere’s some precedent for conference-level concern here. Last year’s Xavier Lucas situation, involving Wisconsin and a contested post spring deadline transfer to Miami, showed that schools and conferences especially the Big 10, are increasingly willing to push back when they believe rules or agreements are being exploited. While the Williams case is different in its facts, it sits in the same gray area where NIL, transfers, and enforcement collide. According to Thamel they might be getting involved again.\n\nAt this point, the key questions are whether Washington actually takes formal action, whether Williams stays in the portal, and how other schools respond while this is unresolved. If this escalates, it could become one of the first real tests of how enforceable NIL agreements are in the transfer era, with implications far beyond one quarterback or one program.",
