        "title": "For anyone want context on Kyle Whittinghams departure from Utah",

        "selftext": "ive seen a lot of comments about Kyles departure from Utah. I understand that it was messy, i understand theres some layers here, and i understand that people are not necessarily paying close attention to whats going on at Utah on that level. I would be surprised if you were.\n\nJust wanted to lay it out for anyone that cares.\n\nas Kyle Whittingham aged, he started to say that he didnt have an interest in coaching beyond 65. He didnt want to be a lifer. This lead to Morgan Scalley being named the head coach in waiting in 2019. Kyle had received HC offers for a long time, and at that point, Morgan started to receive significant offers as well. Utahs 2019 defense was one of the best in the country, and half of them have been long time NFL starters, on top of the others who were drafted.\n\na few years later, Morgans HC in waiting title was stripped, but Kyle was the one pounding the table for it to be reinstated, as he felt he was the one to lead the program for the foreseeable future.\n\nFlash forward to 2024. It was widely accepted to be Kyles last year, including by Kyle himself. Cam Rising goes down (again :( ...) and Utah gets gutted by injuries beyond finishing the year with qb5 on the way to a 5-7 record. Kyle walks off the field in game 12 with his wife and tears in his eyes. Its his last game.\n\nweeks go on, and the competitive motherfucker that Kyle is, decides he cant go out like that. Morgan is understandably upset, as everything he was told until then was that its his go in 2025. When the dust settles, he decides to stay on and let Kyle go for a last dance and end on a good note\n\nUtah has a pretty damn good team in 2025, and ends up a few plays short of their goals. Something changes with Kyle here. I think Kyle being that close to having his go in the playoff, something hes wanted since Utah was denied the shot to play for it all in 2008, lights that competitive fire in him again. He decides hes not done.\n\nHe decides again that he wants to come back. But, as evidence by his 5 year deal. Hes not really close to done yet. Morgan had been getting significant interest across the country, he understandably is not willing to stay around for however long Kyle decides he wants to go, especially if its multiple years for an undetermined amount of time.\n\nand heres where it lands. If Kyle comes back, Morgan is gone. Utah decision makers leaned toward the future of the program that was anointed in Morgan Scalley. I dont believe Kyle was told he could not return, but admin told him they didnt want to lose Scalley and the future of the program. I do understand if people without my bias can read this as he was forced out. Im sure Kyle felt some type of way that the AD put his support behind the other horse.\n\nMost Utah fans have strong belief in Morgan as the future, but also love Kyle and will support him to the end. Like i said, its messy. You understand why Morgan wouldnt be willing to wait forever. Do you potentially mortgage the future for the next 5 years? I personally believe Kyle earned the right to do whatever he wanted. It wasnt handled perfectly on many levels.\n\nWhat i do know for sure, if you are saying this was because of private equity in any way, you're......lacking information. To put it nicely.\n\nfor the 12 people that have read this far, im open to questions or discussion below\n\nedit: i forgot that im posting about Michigans new HC and this post might actually become visible. Thats on me.",

If Michigan needs a coach in 4 years due to Kyle retiring without a  head coach in waiting we can pull from a large group of options. If utah doesn’t take their coach in waiting they are going to have significantly less options. ",

He could walk\" okay, let him. He has no proven HC experience. We're gonna shove our 20 year winningest coach out for a first time coach? I would let Kyle stay, let Scalley walk, and hire Jay Hill to HC when Kyle called it quits. Not flawless, but better than the gutting of staff we're about to face. \n\nWhat else do you guys have?",
