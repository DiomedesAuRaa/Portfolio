        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1q29n7p/ranking_the_mlb_teams_according_to_how_cool_it/",
        "selftext": "Hello and Happy New Year to r/baseball. It is 2026, pitchers and catchers start reporting in a little over a month, and our hearts collectively gleam with ~~cholesterol buildup~~ hope that this will be the year that greatness happens. By which I of course mean successfully playing an interesting MLB team name in a game of Scrabble\\*.\n\nA few notes that many of you won't read:\n\n* For those of you who may not be familiar with Scrabble (and/or play with so many house rules that you've completely forgotten the actual rules of the game), a play is made by using the 7 tiles in your tile rack to construct a single legal word on the board, where that word must be in a spot where it connects to at least one other word (unless you are going first) and where it does not result in the creation of any illegal words.\n* In deciding whether or not a word is legal, I am using the [official Scrabble dictionary](https://scrabble.merriam.com/). If you want to gripe about whether or not your team's name is allowed, for the love of all that is holy please direct those comments to them and not to me.\n* I will be using the teams' official names as stated on [mlb.com](http://mlb.com/), and no short versions or nicknames, with two caveats. First, where a team name is two words, I am ignoring the spacing if doing so results in an otherwise-playable word, so Toronto fans finally catch a break. Second, I am open to using either the singular or plural of each team name to the extent it might matter.\n* I am only considering plays of the team name, and not situations where the team name might be incidentally formed by playing a different word. This means that we are only considering playing the word \"met\" as such, and not playing something like \"quartz\" off of \"me\" and incidentally forming \"met\" as a consequence.\n* While \"cool\"-ness is inherently subjective, I consider in this calculation the Scrabble score for the team name, the likelihood of getting the 50-point bonus for using all 7 letters, any exotic/high-point letters in the team name, and such other factors as I will describe in probably too much detail below. Listed scores are for the pluralized official team name unless otherwise indicated.\n* As always, these rankings are just for fun, and do not necessarily reflect my feelings vis-a-vis these teams, their players, their ownership, or their fans (unless I explicitly say otherwise).\n\n\\* Scrabble is a registered trademark of Hasbro, Inc. in the U.S. and Canada, but I'm not going to try to type the (R) symbol every time, so Hasbro can just go bite me. \n\n**Tier One: Not Legal Scrabble Words** (but I'll rank 'em anyway)\n\n**30: Houston Astros** (6 points) -- Neither \"[astro](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/astro)\" nor \"[astros](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/astros)\" is recognized as a legal Scrabble word; and moreover it isn't even worth fighting about because it would be such a crappy play.  \n\n**29: Philadelphia Phillies** (13 points) -- None of \"[phil](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/phil),\" \"[philly](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/philly),\" \"[phillie](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/phillie),\" or \"[phillies](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/phillies)\" are legal, to what I hope is no one's surprise. Before anyone asks, I'm not going to consider \"filly.\" And do you really want to be fillies, guys? Young female horses generally considered too young to breed despite being sexually mature? Is that what you REALLY want?\n\n**28: New York Yankees** (14 points) -- Neither \"[yankee](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/yankee)\" nor \"[yankees](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/yankees)\" is playable, which I admit I was moderately surprised to learn. If I relaxed the rules and allowed \"yank,\" that would jump them all the way up to Tier 4, but this isn't Vietnam. This is r/baseball and we have rules. And that rug really tied the room together.\n\n**27: Boston Red Sox** (14 points)\n\n**26: Chicago White Sox** (21 points) -- In what will be fantastic news for Bostonian and Southsider Scrabble enthusiasts, \"sox,\" standing alone, is indeed [Scrabble-legal](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/sox). However, no singular or plural permutation of whitesock/x or redsock/x is similarly playable. Which is really too bad for the White Sox in particular, which otherwise would be a fantastic Scrabble play.\n\n**Tier Two: How My Idiot Sister Plays Scrabble**\n\n**25: Cincinnati Reds** (5 points) -- Literally the lowest-possible Scrabble score for a full team name.\n\n**24: New York Mets** (met) (5 points) -- \"Mets\" is not a legal play, so the score listed is for \"met,\" which is the type of word one plays to communicate that they are not interested in playing Scrabble anymore. \n\n**23: San Francisco Giants** (7 points)\n\n**22: Los Angeles Angels** (7 points) -- Fun fact: I got nearly all the way to the end of these rankings before realizing I had forgotten the Angels. Anyway, the Angels' run of dominance is finally over, which is a funny sentence to type.\n\n**21: Detroit Tigers** (7 points) -- The potentially good news with these three words is that you nearly cleared your rack. The bad news is you wasted a lot of useful letters while only managing to match the score of your 6-year-old child's last play. I can't think of a single objective rationale for putting either the Giants or the Angels ahead of the other, so the Angels win because I'm a Dodgers fan; while the Tigers get an edge over both of them because of the scientific fact that tigers are inherently cool.\n\n**Tier Three: Unremarkable Words that are Nevertheless too Complex for my Idiot Sister**\n\n**20: San Diego Padres** (9 points) -- Yes, \"padres\" is a [playable word](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/padres). English is a linguistic melting pot and all that. Congratulations and enjoy your 9 points.\n\n**19: Kansas City Royals** (9 points) -- Royals get the nod over the Padres for the high-value letter, and (to a much lesser extent) because of the Lorde song. \n\n**Tier Four: Emergency Plays for Emergency Situations**\n\n**18: Tampa Bay Rays** (7 points) -- Sometimes you have to deal with an unforgiving board. \"Rays\" offers nearly as many points as the duo above, but in significantly fewer letters, which means this might be a smart strategic play on some boards (although obviously you would usually prefer to save the S). Plus the Y offers potential for double-letter/triple-letter shenanigans. This is what you should have played instead of \"Royals,\" Lorde be damned.\n\n**17: Minnesota Twins** (8 points) -- Eh. The W is nice enough, but why aren't you playing \"wit\" instead? Or \"nit,\" and save the W for a better opportunity? You're playing like my idiot sister. Whom I should stress does not have a developmental disability or anything like that, and is just a regular idiot.\n\n**16: Chicago Cubs** (8 points) -- Solid bang for your buck here, with C and B worth 3 points each. On a bad board with a tray full of vowels, you could do worse. Like \"met.\" Or \"red.\" Or trying to argue for \"astro.\"\n\n**Tier Five: The Braves Tier**\n\n**15: Atlanta Braves** (11 points) -- A borderline play in a vacuum, but juuuust good enough to keep them out of Tier 3. If anyone is curious, the Scrabble dictionary recognizes \"braves,\" but only in the sense of how someone braves danger. \n\n**Tier Six: The Rockies Tier**\n\n**14: Colorado Rockies** (rocky) (14 points) -- \"Rockies\" is [not playable](https://scrabble.merriam.com/finder/rockies), but \"rocky\" sure is, for a solid 14 points and the best possible score for a team name that does not offer the possibility of landing that sweet 50-point bonus. Speaking of which ...\n\n**Tier Seven: Seven-Letter Names That are Otherwise Pretty Crappy**\n\n**13: Baltimore Orioles** (7 points) -- In a vacuum \"orioles\" is about as crappy of a Scrabble word as it gets, without a single letter worth more than one point. But for this and all subsequent team names, the 50-point bonus for using all seven letters has now become a possibility. This is why S's are so valuable in Scrabble, since you can just lay out \"orioles\" in its entirety right off the end of your idiot sister's play of \"red,\" creating two crappy words plus that 50-point bonus and causing her to flip the board over and go running to Mom to demand that I stop cheating.\n\n**12: Texas Rangers** (8 points) -- Better get that 50 points, because otherwise what a waste of great letters.\n\n**11: Miami Marlins** (9 points)\n\n**10: Pittsburgh Pirates** (9 points) -- Nothing much interesting to say between these two. Pirates are badass sea criminals and marlins are fairly badass giant sport fish. Slight edge to pirates in the cool department, but if you want to argue the reverse I won't squawk.\n\n**9: Los Angeles Dodgers** (10 points) -- There are only 4 D's in the whole tile bag, and you somehow got two of them at the same time. It's unfair! Baseball is ruined!\n\n**8: Milwaukee Brewers** (12 points) -- If I make MLB team rankings for another 100 offseasons, I will never live down the fiasco of Brewer Hicklen. And also I suppose this would be a reasonably respectable Scrabble play.\n\n**Tier Eight: They Will Talk About This Play For Years**\n\n**7: Seattle Mariners** (10 points) -- The Mariners juuuuust squeak into this tier by virtue of requiring one more letter than you could possibly have on your rack, meaning that you'd have to have at least one letter free on the board to accommodate this play. Luckily almost every letter in \"mariners\" shouldn't be too hard to find on the board, although it is amusing to me to imagine someone with \"mariner\" sitting in their rack waiting for an open S to play it on.\n\n**6: Washington Nationals** (9 points) -- Like the Orioles, the Nationals' team name is about as bad as it gets, consisting entirely of 1-point letters. However, it would still make for a rather cool play, since \"nationals\" is a nine-letter word, which means that you'd have to find a 2-letter word such as \"on\" or \"at\" to build it around, and thereby turn a tray of nothing into a pretty sweet turn -- circumstances unique enough that I'm bumping the Nats one place ahead of the Mariners. At least until your opponent pounces on that open S on their next turn. \n\n**5: Cleveland Guardians** (11 points) -- \"Ar\" and \"an\" are both playable words you could build this off of. And boy oh boy it would be fun to lay this down after mom just helped my idiot sister play \"ar.\" \n\n**4: St. Louis Cardinals** (12 points) -- \"Ar,\" \"in,\" \"na,\" and \"al\" are all potential entry points here, but I'm running out of things to say about 2-letter Scrabble words. How about that Masyn Winn, Cards fans? That kid sure looks great. And also what a great Scrabble name. I mean, he's no Jazz Chisholm, but still...\n\n**Tier Nine: Finally Some Wholly Better Plays** **than \"Rocky\"**\n\n**3: The Philadelphia Athletics of Sacramento** (14 points) -- Ummmm, how about that Masyn Winn, A's fans?\n\n**2: Toronto Blue Jays** (bluejays) (20 points) -- \"Bluejay\" is a FANTASTIC Scrabble word, and also perhaps finally Toronto fans won't yap at me for not allowing \"jay\" on its own. Congratulations, Toronto fans, you've finally done it. Looks like you've got this one all wrapped up. No possible event could foreseeably prevent you from winning this--\n\n**Tier Ten: Why'd it Have to be Snakes?**\n\n**1: Arizona Diamondbacks** (24 points) -- There are those other two D's! Maybe baseball isn't broken after all. What makes \"diamondbacks\" such a cool Scrabble play isn't its length or point total (although those certainly help); it's that the only way you could play it would be if either \"diamond\" or \"backs\" was already on the board. A once-in-lifetime circumstance for a fantastic play.",

Genuinely, I consider this a must watch if you care about business operations\n\nHere’s a summary of very specific topics, but there’s a lot more than this, that I found interesting for those who don’t have the chance to catch the full VOD on Ben’s channel:\n\n-Hecz is against Saudi orgs potentially joining. What’s best is a team like Envy, Telluride or Omit who have owners that actually want to compete and will create storylines with content, personalities etc that help grow the league. A saudi org joining and throwing $1 mil salaries out does not grow the league at all. they don’t get the drama or know how to craft stories \n\n-Activision’s stance on things has completely fucked marketing for everyone. The CDL only has 1 non endemic sponsor left in Monster. How we can smoke a bong as Snoop Dogg/Seth Rogen in game yet can’t have a beer or alcohol related sponsor is absurd.\n\n-CDL dropped Watch Party guidelines for everyone. They are very strict and have implications for how, more so Scump, can operate his. From the size of the cams on scump/zooma, to the overlay designs, the broadcast has to always be showing and cannot be muted, to now what sponsors can be presented. No gambling sponsors allowed. No vaping, smoking, or drinking is allowed on stream either. Sorry Mboze. There are many more guidelines that are posted on the website. \n\n-The agreement for the league, I believe called the TPA, has a set period of time before it expires. They’re not allowed to say when it ends. Likely has implications on expansion, format of the league matches, etc \n\n\nThere’s so much more talked about but just some points that came to mind",

So he just saw our friend die in front of his eyes - and that's it.\"\n\nThe matter of fact way in which Sudan forward John Mano recounts the death of his best friend Medo is at odds with the intense look burning in his eyes as he does so. \n\nMedo is one of more than 150,000 people to have been killed during the country's civil war which began in April 2023.\n\nMano, who debuted for the national team just months before the conflict started, says Medo had travelled to the city of Wadi Halfa, near the border with Egypt, to arrange documentation to leave the country during what the United Nations is calling the world's largest humanitarian crisis.\n\n\"I think they forgot some certificates,\" the 24-year-old tells BBC Sport Africa, speaking at the team's hotel at the ongoing 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Morocco.\n\n\"It was so important for the family and he had to go back. He went to his house and took everything.\n\n\"They caught him. They said, 'Are you working with the army?' He just wanted to explain. But they started shooting him.\"\n\n# 'I cannot forget this until I die'\n\nThe power struggle between Sudan's army and a paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Force (RSF), has also forced more than 12 million people to flee their homes, with widespread famine and reports of genocide in the western Darfur region.\n\nUnsurprisingly, football has taken a back seat. Stadiums have been destroyed and the league halted.\n\nTwo of the country's biggest club sides, Al Hilal and Al Merrikh, are currently playing in the Rwandan league, having spent last season in the Mauritanian top flight.\n\n\"We don't have a league, we don't have anything, but we can't complain because people in my country, they can't eat, they don't have food,\" says Mano.\n\nBut despite all the challenges - including having to play their home Afcon qualifying matches in neutral countries - [Sudan have reached the finals](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn9xpx797x5o) for only the fourth time since 1976.\n\nGhanaian head coach Kwesi Appiah has had to convince players to compete without guarantees of payment and has offered consolation on \"several occasions\" when squad members have lost family members.\n\n\"We try to let players know, even though they're gone, \\[they're\\] looking at you and what you can do now for the nation,\" says the 65-year-old, who took charge in September 2023.\n\n\"I need to give the player maybe two or three days off, to make sure he comes back to himself.\"\n\nSome of the players have not been home in years, with many lucky enough to find a new club overseas.\n\nLike several others in the Falcons of Jediane squad, Mano has made the move to Libya, first joining Al Ahly and now Al Akhdar.\n\nBut the former Al Hilal man did not escape Sudan before experiencing a death threat of his own.\n\n\"The rebels used to stop us and make fun of us on the road,\" he explains.\n\n\"They'd say things like 'You play for Al Hilal - what is Al Hilal? I support Al Merrikh. I can kill you right now and nobody will question me'.\n\n\"I cannot forget this story until I die.\"\n\nAppiah and Sudan captain Bakhit Khamis say part of their role has been creating a family feeling within the squad.\n\n\"Football is the only relief we have as Sudanese people,\" says left-back Khamis, who also currently plays in Libya.\n\n\"It is the only thing that can make us happy and help us forget the pain and suffering we \\[have been\\] through during the period of war.\n\n\"The feeling of unity becomes part of you, you cannot avoid it. Our goal has become stronger - Sudan first, Sudan above everything.\n\n\"This unity is one of the best things that has happened to us. It was able to make us united as one people.\"\n\nAppiah aims to make players feel they can be \"the best in the world\" with the right attitude, inspiring his team to a memorable home win in Libya [over Ghana](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c7813dgy0mro) \\- the country he won the 1982 Afcon with as a player and later managed twice - during their qualifying campaign.\n\nWhen an ambassadorial delegation arrived at the team hotel after the game, the squad discovered that soldiers back in Sudan were celebrating the result.\n\n\"At least for one day, they put their guns down,\" says Appiah, hoping that the war will \"cease totally\" to allow \"everybody to come back home happily\".\n\n\"I believe that, if by grace we are able to win it (Afcon), you never know.\"\n\nWhile hoping the soldiers lay down their guns permanently, Mano describes football as a \"weapon\" to \"fight for my country\".\n\nHe is promising the fans back home that the 1970 champions will battle all the way in Morocco.\n\n\"Some of them (the fans), they can't watch the match, you know that? Not even on the radio, they can't hear.\n\n\"Every day people \\[are\\] dying.\n\n\"We're trying to free our country the football way.\"\n\n[Source.](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cm2vjy3gvl1o)  \n",

I’m holding out hope that not winning a playoff game with the most talented offense in Football 2 seasons in a row has humbled Brad and Dan a little bit to actually bring in guys that will make an impact and not Buddy Buddy contracts.\n\nReader and Anzalone aren’t even worth mentioning they are 100% gone, can add Levi as-well made $4M to sit on the couch all season we need players who actually play. \n\nAmik is a toss up, he has been HORRIBLE the second half of the season but he’s not a CB1 or 2 and was forced to be one so we might bring him back, Davenport is probably finally gone this was a “Prove It” contract for him and he did the opposite. \n\nPaschal is a certified bust and will be lucky to play a starting snap in the NFL again, Awosika is gone drafting more lineman most likely I assume Daniel Thomas is gone for this same reason drafting DB’s and praying Branch/Kerby and the rest of the DB’s are healthy. \n\nMalcolm, Nowaske, Staurd are a toss up Malcolm is probably back and Staurd is a ST’s GOAT. Tyrus Wheat is bad, I have no idea why we got Zach Cunningham. \n\nFinally Kalif Raymond, he will be gone. He’s 32 next season and TeSlaa is taking his WR3 job, Kennedy is a better KR, and we drafted Lovett to replace Raymond as a speedy punt returner possibly and occasionally WR4, we can’t afford to pay old locker room guys with the contract’s coming up. \n\nGuys I see staying. Rock Ya Sin, Roy Lopez, Avonte Maddox, Kyle Allen, Maybe Amik. Then the biggest question mark is Muhammad, he’s 31 and was a ghost half of the games this season but is a solid pass rusher which we desperately need. I see him wanting too much and leaving as we draft or by the grace of God sign a FA edge rusher to replace him. \n\nShould be a fun offseason and we need Brad to have another good draft that fills the teams dire needs.

This season, I say we make some noise and push Isaiah Stewart to be in the 6MOTY conversation.\n\nThe idea came to me when Stew won Eastern Conerence Defensive Player of the Month despite playing off the bench and earning just over 20 mins a game. I know that 6MOTY is almost always rewarded to subs who bring instant offensive firepower. But the prominent names in the sixth man talk right now are not really running away with it. Ajay Mitchell, Naz Reid, and Keldon Johnson are averaging just 3 to 4 ppg more than Stew. NAW's name comes up in some lists, but he has more games as a starter than a sub so he should not be considered.\n\nStew has bigger impact as a sub even if his contribution offensively is not huge. Which of the other 6MOTY candidates serve as a symbol of the identity of their teams? Cade of course is the face of our franchise, but the Pistons are currently leading the East because they are the 2nd best defensive team in the league and Stewart is the face of our defense.\n\nISAIAH STEWART FOR NBA SIXTH MAN OF THE YEAR!\n\n",

There are no signs of Ausar becoming a better shooter. He will not even shoot open 3s which kills our spacing. I do not think we can really afford having two nonshooters share the floor. \n\nObtaining a scoring threat next to Cade makes us legit contenders. We would also see Cade's shot selection improve and efficiency rise because he will not be triple teamed anymore. Pacers were able to take the next step by trading for Siakam. I think we will have to do something similar eventually. \n",
