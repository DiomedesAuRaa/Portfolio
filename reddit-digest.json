        "selftext": "So as we all know, the Indiana Hoosiers just went 16-0 to win their first national title in school history. However, in this post I'll break down why that is actually impossible and they actually went 3-9.\n\n1. Indiana's first 3 games were against FCS teams. So let's say they didn't play any of them, and instead played actually COMPETETIVE teams. Well, who knows what would have happened? So, we can automatically mark those down as losses.\n2. Their Big 10 Opener was against Illinois, who put up an atrocious performance against them, losing 63-10. However, we can ALSO pencil that one down as a loss. Why? Because the next week, Fernando Mendoza lead a game winning drive against Iowa, and won 20-15. We all know game winning drives are pure luck, not skill, so that is technically a loss. But as a Nebraska fan, I refuse to give Iowa a win in this situation, so instead I will give it to Illinois.\n3. Indiana is now 1-4 walking into Eugene against Oregon, where they win 30-20. However, that one is also a loss because Oregon was ranked #3 at the time, so for Indiana to win that, that would mean they were at minimum a #2 team that night. #2 teams have national championship hopes, however 4 loss teams don't. So it just wouldn't make sense for Indiana to win that one. 1-5.\n4. Then they play Michigan State, who put up the second best performance against Indiana as an unranked team. But, actually it's the best performance they put up, because we already marked Iowa as a loss, remember? And if your a team putting up the best performance against someone who's 1-5 as an unranked team, that pretty much means a win right? So now, Indiana is 1-6.\n5. Then they blew out UCLA 56-6, but that wouldn't really make a whole lotta sense, because UCLA was on a 3 game win streak, just having upset #2 Penn State. Therefore, it wouldn't be logical for UCLA to end all that momentum against a 1-6 team. Indiana's 1-7.\n6. Then the very next week, they play @ Maryland who they blew out 55-10. That's only because Indiana was motivated and had a lot of momentum with their fraudulent wins, you can only imagine they wouldn't have that much motivation as a 1-7 team. So we can count that as a one possession win for Indiana. BUT, since it was AT Maryland, Maryland got that home field advantage, so that means a loss for the Hoosiers.\n7. Then Indiana played Penn State which they won out of pure luck. This is because that crazy catch on that game winning drive was improbable, because what if there was just a slight gust of wind, and blew the receiver just a few inches to the side? Wouldn't had been a catch, and instead out of bounds, so Indiana would have lost. 1-9.\n8. The next 2 games we can count as wins, because as a Nebraska fan I can't give Wisconsin a win, and according to my perfect algorithm, Purdue was the worst team in the Big 10 and Indiana was the 2nd worst team, so Purdue would have lost.\n9. A 3-9 team obviously can't make the conference championship or the playoffs, so all those extra wins disappear.\n\nAnd there you have it folks, the perfect and most logical explanation for how Indiana's season should have went.",

That did not happen.\n\nAfter we waited hours, his security firmly told us he is not signing anything at all, and we did not get to talk to him at all, he did not say a word to anyone. \n\nWe were lined up and all the kids got was a photo, and he did not seem impressed about that. \n\nHe had his hands in his pockets and did not smile or put his arm around any kids in any photos. \n\nHe knew the kids were sick, and still did not put any effort or acknowledgement to that. \n\nEveryone was so disgusted in his behaviour, it was honestly so disappointing. \n\nOne of the familys drove 6 and a half hours to meet him, and the kids where so extremely sad in the end. He seemed to think he was better than everyone else, and it was obvious he did not want to have anything to do with a group of sick kids. \n\nAs parents and siblings of children with life threatening diseases, we are deeply disappointed in Allen Iversons actions and he needs to do better.",

So in this instance Arsenal basically surround the oppositions goalkeeper on corners, the goalkeeper struggles to win any balls in the air, punches, catches etc. Arsenal have a tall team so it causes chaos. its been wildly successful leadjng to people saying they rely on set piece goals rather than open play. They are currently  4 points clear at the top of the Premier League and 1st place in the champions league standings.\n\nThe parking the bus strategy we've been seeing in overload (again another term derived from football) is another example of Haramball. Teams would show up, put 10 men behind the ball, camped on their own box and invite the other team to try and break them down. Games would often end in 0-0s or 1-0 for the parking team who'd score on the counter attack late on etc. The term came from Jose Mourinho years ago describing the play style as \"they brought the team bus and parked it infront of the goal\"",

        "selftext": "Rivalry week for the men’s and women’s basketball teams, men go to Breslin on a Friday and women go Sunday, both will be top 15 ranked matchups. Has me reflecting on this rivalry. I grew up in the Lansing area so I was always surrounded by the rivalry - everyone I knew had some connection to MSU. My parents went to MSU, though my mom did grad at umich when I was young so I always supported Michigan and ended up going to Michigan. I noticed pretty quickly a lot of my out of state friends didn’t really view the rivalry the same at all which is understandable. Obviously it’s MSU’s main rivalry so growing up around MSU it felt all encompassing. The rivalry used to be fun, I mean it was tense and there was plenty of shit talking and all that but it was fun. Seemed to really shift around the late 2010s, the Devin Bush stomping was a big flash point  and culminated to the point of no return with the tunnel jumping. Now it’s so divisive and toxic I hardly enjoy it anymore. Feels like fans have lost the plot a bit and they have real life hatred towards each other. I know every school has a segment of crazed fans but you’d think Michigan personally harmed a lot of Spartan fans, they legit hate Michigan more than they love their own team. \n\nTLDR- what are your thoughts on the Michigan/ MSU rivalry? Feels really toxic which drains a lot of the fun out of it for me. ",

They still have the East’s best record (8-3) in January and their coaching staff is going to L.A. for the All-Star Game(s).\n\nThree takeaways\n\nLike most of the league, the Pistons have had some offensive issues of late. Prior to Sunday, they had a six-game stretch where they scored just 106.1 points per 100 possessions, with turnovers a recurring issue. Cade Cunningham missed two of those games and shot 18-for-60 (30%) in the other four.\n\nBut the Pistons got to play the Kings on Sunday afternoon, and they had their most efficient offensive performance of the season, scoring 139 points on 100 possessions. Cunningham led eight Pistons in double-figures with 29 points on 13-for-22 shooting. He’s shot worse both in the paint and from 3-point range than he did last season, but his overall efficiency (true shooting percentage) is down just a tick, because his free throw rate (35.9 attempts per 100 shots from the field) is the highest of his career by a wide margin.\n\nDespite the loss to Houston on Friday, the Pistons still have the best record (14-6) in games played between the 17 teams that are currently over .500. Of course, their visit to Denver on Tuesday will be their first game against one of the top three teams in the West.\n\nComing up: The Pistons have spent most of January at home, but they’ll close the month with their final three games in the Mountain or Pacific time zones. They’re an impressive 5-0 in rest-disadvantage games and will be at a disadvantage at Golden State on Friday.\n\nWeek 15: @ DEN, @ PHX, @ GSW, vs. BKN",

We've all kinda become trapped by that idea.”*\n\nThought this was a pretty sharp way to describe not just the character but something about the world we’re in right now. The whole getting absorbed in things happening out there as a way to avoid dealing with more personal stuff feels very familiar.\n\nAlso hard not to feel at least a little called out reading this on a subreddit dedicated to overanalyzing podcasts about pop culture and sports. Which to be clear I’m very much part of",
