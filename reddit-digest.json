Entered the playoffs cold and lost in the Wild Card round.\n\n• **2024 Pittsburgh Steelers**  \nFinished 10-7 but dropped their last four games. Several outlets noted they were only the third team in NFL history to enter the playoffs on a four-game losing streak.\n\n• **1986 New York Jets** (a little different but worth mentioning)  \nThey lost five straight to end the season, still made the playoffs, and actually won their Wild Card game before losing the next round.\n\nSo if the Packers lose this Vikings game and head into the playoffs on a four-game skid, they would be joining a list that is basically two teams long, or three if you include the Jets with the longer streak.",

I still think I have something to give on the pitch.\"\n\n\"Allegri is a bit like Ancelotti, he's funny and loves to play pranks. He is a great guy. Carlo will always be my #1. We've spoken about Milan many times while I was at Madrid.\"\n\n\"Mourinho was the one who brought me to Madrid, I'm sorry I only had one season with him. He was the toughest manager of my career. He made Cristiano cry in the locker room because he didn't track back. He is very direct and honest. He treated Ramos and a new player equally.\"",

That’s not empty stat padding that’s instant impact, efficient offense, and real two-way juice. He comes in, spaces the floor, pressures the ball, and doesn’t need the offense run for him to contribute.\n\nWhat really stands out is how natural he looks in the role. He’s decisive, plays under control, and doesn’t hijack possessions. That’s exactly what you want next to Cade or running the second unit.",
