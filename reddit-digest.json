He's obviously tailing off, but you look at those other guys on that list and he still seems years away from being at that level, and those guys were mostly worthy rotation players when they retired. \n\n\nWe'll obviously never know because he'll retire years before he's the 8th guy in a rotation playing 12 MPG, but that really does seem like it would be 5+ years away at this point. ",

Taking that into consideration it's easy to think it's not as impressive a feat as the headline first makes out. However to be in your 50s and physically be capable of doing even just cameos when for many people (including ex athletes) at that age just having one charity match can cause injury is very impressive. Plus looking at his overall career while he never emulated his success in Japan when he went overseas, in his prime he was a beast. 118 goals in 197 games between 1992 and 1998.",

It became a clumsy (and overly precious, on top of that) pastiche of Marvel/Superhero storytelling in cheap 80s drag, and not any kind of King/Spielberg/Carpenter homage anymore.\n\nThe most 80s thing about it is that it got dumber, worse, and more expensive as it kept going, and then went long past the point of it ever hoping to be good again.
