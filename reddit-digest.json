It’s not just about volume, either—their efficiency is elite, ranking 3rd in the league for the season (37.8%) and 1st since January 1st (39.4%).\n\n\n\nBall (24) is under contract through 2029, Miller (23) becomes extension-eligible after this season, and Knueppel (20) is in the 1st year of his rookie contract. Barring any setbacks, these three are likely to make a name for themselves as the league’s new 3-point trio for a long time.\n\n  \n",

Pleased we can now return to battling things out on track and focus on what’s set to be an exciting IndyCar season.”\n\nAnd from Chip Ganassi:\n\n“I’m happy to confirm that we have reached a final settlement with McLaren Racing following a UK judge ruling in January.\nI cannot condone what happened and I’m glad that the matter is over.

        "selftext": "Hey yall,\n\nFreep and DetNews have been reporting on this, but I see that a lot of people are having a hard time dealing with the pay wall. \n\nUltimately, it's not clear if investigators have probable cause to arrest TA... yet. But that may change depending on how the case progresses. \n\nHere's the summary:\n\nTA's rental home was robbed recently. TA's camp suspected that his driver (call him, \"the Driver\") was the culprit. TA's camp reported it to the police. \n\nLater, TA's girlfriend (call her \"the GF\") coordinated with three other people in TA's orbit (together, the \"co-Defendants\") to retaliate. The GF directed one co-Defendant to lure the Driver to an apartment where two others awaited with firearms. When the Driver and the driver's associates arrived, the co-Defendants attacked and robbed the Driver and his associates. \n\nApparently, the GF coordinated everything via a text group chat. It is not clear if TA was in the chat group. \n\nIt does not appear the court order attributes any criminal actions to TA himself. That would explain why he hasn't been arrested - no probable cause yet. Considering all of this was coordinated ***in*** ***writing*** (lol), that's a good sign for TA. \n\nNevertheless, that can change. If one of the co-Defendants orally implicates TA in the conspiracy to kidnap and rob the driver, he will likely be indicted -- and the Lions will probably cut him. \n\nSo far, we do not actually know if TA did anything \"wrong.\" Nothing beyond his alleged relationships to the people involved actually ties him to the alleged crime. Theoretically, this could have happened outside of his knowledge.  Ultimate the State has the burden of proving otherwise. \n\n\\*\\*\\* \n\nWe do know, at the VERY LEAST, that TA needs to exercise much better judgement about the people he associates with. \n\nI really like TA. I've seen him interact with fans at Training camp. Watched his podcast. Seen how Saban talked about him. By all accounts he seems like a really good kid. \n\nIF HE DID conspire to rob the driver, that would strike me as inconsistent with my observations of his character and, tragically, would warrant his dismissal from the team. \n\nBut we aren't there yet. All we can do is wait and see. \n\nThe obvious question is: what does this mean for the Lions?\n\nWell... you CANT assume that TA won't be implicated. ***The team needs to operate under the assumption that one of the co-Defendants will implicate TA in exchange for favorable treatment by the DA***. So even though we don't know if TA will be arrested, they need to treat CB as a need this off-season. ",
