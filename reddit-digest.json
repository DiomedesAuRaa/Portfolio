        "selftext": "Pool C (March 5–10, Tokyo Dome): **◎** Japan, Australia; ▲ South Korea, Czech Republic; ○ Taiwan\n\nIn this tournament, only one pool will be hosted in Asia, and for the first time since the second edition in 2009, Asian powerhouses Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have been placed in the same group. Defending champion Japan stands out as a dominant force, while South Korea and Taiwan are evenly matched in terms of talent, making the battle for second place likely to be fierce.\n\n**Japan**\n\nDefending champion Japan saw Shohei Ohtani quickly commit to participating in the tournament. It is also a major boost that Japan has a clear path to calling up a certain number of MLB players, including Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Munetaka Murakami, whose new team, the White Sox, has approved his participation despite this being his first year in the majors.\n\nIn the past, Japan’s failures to win the title were closely tied to the lack of MLB players: in 2013 the team was composed entirely of NPB players, and in 2017 the only MLB player was Norichika Aoki, then with the Astros.\n\nThis time, as in the previous tournament, Ohtani was once again the first to announce his participation, and his decision has triggered a similar wave of MLB players joining the team. Even if Ohtani serves solely as a designated hitter, if Japan can assemble a rotation featuring Yamamoto along with Shota Imanaga (32, Cubs), Yusei Kikuchi (34, Angels), and Tomoyuki Sugano (36, Orioles FA), the starting pitching staff would be among the best in the tournament. Japan can reasonably be considered one of the title favorites alongside the United States and the Dominican Republic. Ideally, Japan would cruise through the first round with four straight wins, leaving South Korea, Taiwan, and Australia to battle it out for second place.\n\n**Taiwan**\n\nThe opponent Japan should be most wary of is Taiwan, the champion of the 2024 Premier12. Taiwan’s position players include infielder Yu Chang (30, Fubon), a former Red Sox player who hit a grand slam against the Netherlands in the previous WBC; outfielder Chen Chieh-hsien (31, Uni-Lions), who was named MVP of the Premier12; and power-hitting catcher Giljegiljaw Kungkuan (31, Wei Chuan), whose name pronunciation became a topic of discussion in Japan during the Premier12. All of them have been named to the provisional roster.\n\nThe key question is how Taiwan will deploy its ace left-hander, Lin Yu-Min (22), who pitches for the Diamondbacks’ Triple-A affiliate. In the Premier12 final against Japan, he started and shut down Samurai Japan, allowing just one hit and no runs over four innings. Taiwan opens the first round against Australia on March 5, with the Japan game on March 6 as its second contest. For Japan, however, the game against Taiwan will be its tournament opener. Given that many of Japan’s core hitters—Ohtani, Murakami, Teruaki Sato, Yoshida, and Kondo—are left-handed, facing Lin Yu-Min right away could pose significant challenges.\n\nThat said, the first round has a strict pitch limit of 65 pitches, and even if Taiwan starts Lin Yu-Min, there is no guarantee they can secure a win against Japan. If Taiwan prioritizes advancing safely from the first round, it may be more effective to save its ace for a direct showdown with South Korea, the team it is likely to be battling for second place, rather than using him against Japan.\n\n**Korea**\n\nIf there is a team determined to prioritize a win against Japan, it is South Korea. Their strong results—reaching the semifinals in 2006 and finishing as runners-up in 2009—are now a thing of the past. South Korea has failed to advance beyond the first round in each of the past three tournaments. That said, baseball enthusiasm in the KBO is on the rise, highlighted by a record-breaking attendance of over 12 million in 2025, the first time in league history.\n\nBuilding on the roster that faced Japan in November, South Korea is in a position to call up MLB position players such as outfielder Jung-hoo Lee (27, Giants) and infielder Hyeseong Kim (26, Dodgers). While there are no MLB pitchers on the staff, veteran left-hander Hyun-jin Ryu (38, Hanwha), a former Dodger with a proven track record, has joined the pre-tournament training camp in Saipan.\n\nIn the previous tournament, South Korea finished 2–2 and was eliminated in the first round after losses to Japan and Australia. One could argue that the outcome might have been different had they effectively sacrificed the Japan game and focused entirely on beating Australia. After that tournament, I once discussed the WBC with a Korean journalist and asked, “If they had gone all-in on the Australia game by essentially giving up on Japan, could they have beaten Cuba in the round of 16 and made it to Miami?” The response was, “That may well be correct, but in Korea, a manager who adopts a strategy that assumes defeat against Japan from the outset would never be accepted.”\n\n“The idea that ‘you must not lose the Korea–Japan game, even if it’s rock-paper-scissors,’ is not a joke—it’s real. Even if advancing in second place is the realistic goal, you can’t be that blatant,” he explained.\n\nSouth Korea opens against the Czech Republic on March 5, then faces Japan, Taiwan, and Australia in three consecutive games starting on March 7. Given the schedule, aggressively targeting a win against Japan may not be the most pragmatic approach, but the likelihood of treating it as a “throwaway game” is low. As a left-hander, Hyun-jin Ryu is a strong candidate to start that game.\n\nWhile it is an unpleasant scenario to contemplate, the worst-case outcome for Japan would be if both Taiwan and South Korea choose to challenge Japan head-on, forcing Japan to deal with the ace left-handers of both teams. If Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan were all to finish 3–1, advancement could come down to run differential, raising the unlikely but not impossible risk of a shock first-round exit for Japan.\n\n***Australia***\n\nAustralia, which reached the quarterfinals in the previous tournament, will once again be led by head coach Dave Nilsson (56), who played in Japan’s NPB for the Chunichi Dragons under the registered name “Dingo.” Participation has already been confirmed for pitcher Liam Hendriks (36, Red Sox FA) and infielder Travis Bazzana (23, Guardians organization).\n\nAustralia is scheduled to face Taiwan in its opening game and South Korea in its final game, and the results of Australia’s games are likely to have a major impact on how this pool plays out. Having defeated South Korea in the previous tournament, Australia has enough strength to prevent the battle for second place from being a contest solely between Taiwan and South Korea.\n\n**Czech**\n\nThe Czech Republic, which earned a historic first victory over China in its WBC debut at the previous tournament, will once again feature players who parlayed their performances last time into opportunities to play in Japan. These include former Yomiuri Giants infielder Marek Chlup (26) and former BC League Kanagawa infielder Milan Prokop (22). Pitcher Ondřej Satoria (28), who struck out Shohei Ohtani with a 126 km/h changeup, is also expected to participate and should attract plenty of attention. However, having been placed in a tougher pool than last time, a single win may be hard to come by.\n\n**While it is relatively easy to predict Japan finishing first and the Czech Republic fifth, the three teams—Taiwan, South Korea, and Australia—are likely to be locked in a fierce battle. Based on their Premier12 championship pedigree, Taiwan is projected to finish second, followed by South Korea in third due to an unfavorable game schedule, with Australia predicted to place fourth.**\n\nhttps://www.iza.ne.jp/article/20260102-FREHOXSOXJFCJFELXDEJI5YFNQ/",

Genuinely, I consider this a must watch if you care about business operations\n\nHere’s a summary of very specific topics, but there’s a lot more than this, that I found interesting for those who don’t have the chance to catch the full VOD on Ben’s channel:\n\n-Hecz is against Saudi orgs potentially joining. What’s best is a team like Envy, Telluride or Omit who have owners that actually want to compete and will create storylines with content, personalities etc that help grow the league. A saudi org joining and throwing $1 mil salaries out does not grow the league at all. they don’t get the drama or know how to craft stories \n\n-Activision’s stance on things has completely fucked marketing for everyone. The CDL only has 1 non endemic sponsor left in Monster. How we can smoke a bong as Snoop Dogg/Seth Rogen in game yet can’t have a beer or alcohol related sponsor is absurd.\n\n-CDL dropped Watch Party guidelines for everyone. They are very strict and have implications for how, more so Scump, can operate his. From the size of the cams on scump/zooma, to the overlay designs, the broadcast has to always be showing and cannot be muted, to now what sponsors can be presented. No gambling sponsors allowed. No vaping, smoking, or drinking is allowed on stream either. Sorry Mboze. There are many more guidelines that are posted on the website. \n\n-The agreement for the league, I believe called the TPA, has a set period of time before it expires. They’re not allowed to say when it ends. Likely has implications on expansion, format of the league matches, etc \n\n\nThere’s so much more talked about but just some points that came to mind",

So he just saw our friend die in front of his eyes - and that's it.\"\n\nThe matter of fact way in which Sudan forward John Mano recounts the death of his best friend Medo is at odds with the intense look burning in his eyes as he does so. \n\nMedo is one of more than 150,000 people to have been killed during the country's civil war which began in April 2023.\n\nMano, who debuted for the national team just months before the conflict started, says Medo had travelled to the city of Wadi Halfa, near the border with Egypt, to arrange documentation to leave the country during what the United Nations is calling the world's largest humanitarian crisis.\n\n\"I think they forgot some certificates,\" the 24-year-old tells BBC Sport Africa, speaking at the team's hotel at the ongoing 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Morocco.\n\n\"It was so important for the family and he had to go back. He went to his house and took everything.\n\n\"They caught him. They said, 'Are you working with the army?' He just wanted to explain. But they started shooting him.\"\n\n# 'I cannot forget this until I die'\n\nThe power struggle between Sudan's army and a paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Force (RSF), has also forced more than 12 million people to flee their homes, with widespread famine and reports of genocide in the western Darfur region.\n\nUnsurprisingly, football has taken a back seat. Stadiums have been destroyed and the league halted.\n\nTwo of the country's biggest club sides, Al Hilal and Al Merrikh, are currently playing in the Rwandan league, having spent last season in the Mauritanian top flight.\n\n\"We don't have a league, we don't have anything, but we can't complain because people in my country, they can't eat, they don't have food,\" says Mano.\n\nBut despite all the challenges - including having to play their home Afcon qualifying matches in neutral countries - [Sudan have reached the finals](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn9xpx797x5o) for only the fourth time since 1976.\n\nGhanaian head coach Kwesi Appiah has had to convince players to compete without guarantees of payment and has offered consolation on \"several occasions\" when squad members have lost family members.\n\n\"We try to let players know, even though they're gone, \\[they're\\] looking at you and what you can do now for the nation,\" says the 65-year-old, who took charge in September 2023.\n\n\"I need to give the player maybe two or three days off, to make sure he comes back to himself.\"\n\nSome of the players have not been home in years, with many lucky enough to find a new club overseas.\n\nLike several others in the Falcons of Jediane squad, Mano has made the move to Libya, first joining Al Ahly and now Al Akhdar.\n\nBut the former Al Hilal man did not escape Sudan before experiencing a death threat of his own.\n\n\"The rebels used to stop us and make fun of us on the road,\" he explains.\n\n\"They'd say things like 'You play for Al Hilal - what is Al Hilal? I support Al Merrikh. I can kill you right now and nobody will question me'.\n\n\"I cannot forget this story until I die.\"\n\nAppiah and Sudan captain Bakhit Khamis say part of their role has been creating a family feeling within the squad.\n\n\"Football is the only relief we have as Sudanese people,\" says left-back Khamis, who also currently plays in Libya.\n\n\"It is the only thing that can make us happy and help us forget the pain and suffering we \\[have been\\] through during the period of war.\n\n\"The feeling of unity becomes part of you, you cannot avoid it. Our goal has become stronger - Sudan first, Sudan above everything.\n\n\"This unity is one of the best things that has happened to us. It was able to make us united as one people.\"\n\nAppiah aims to make players feel they can be \"the best in the world\" with the right attitude, inspiring his team to a memorable home win in Libya [over Ghana](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c7813dgy0mro) \\- the country he won the 1982 Afcon with as a player and later managed twice - during their qualifying campaign.\n\nWhen an ambassadorial delegation arrived at the team hotel after the game, the squad discovered that soldiers back in Sudan were celebrating the result.\n\n\"At least for one day, they put their guns down,\" says Appiah, hoping that the war will \"cease totally\" to allow \"everybody to come back home happily\".\n\n\"I believe that, if by grace we are able to win it (Afcon), you never know.\"\n\nWhile hoping the soldiers lay down their guns permanently, Mano describes football as a \"weapon\" to \"fight for my country\".\n\nHe is promising the fans back home that the 1970 champions will battle all the way in Morocco.\n\n\"Some of them (the fans), they can't watch the match, you know that? Not even on the radio, they can't hear.\n\n\"Every day people \\[are\\] dying.\n\n\"We're trying to free our country the football way.\"\n\n[Source.](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cm2vjy3gvl1o)  \n",

This season, I say we make some noise and push Isaiah Stewart to be in the 6MOTY conversation.\n\nThe idea came to me when Stew won Eastern Conerence Defensive Player of the Month despite playing off the bench and earning just over 20 mins a game. I know that 6MOTY is almost always rewarded to subs who bring instant offensive firepower. But the prominent names in the sixth man talk right now are not really running away with it. Ajay Mitchell, Naz Reid, and Keldon Johnson are averaging just 3 to 4 ppg more than Stew. NAW's name comes up in some lists, but he has more games as a starter than a sub so he should not be considered.\n\nStew has bigger impact as a sub even if his contribution offensively is not huge. Which of the other 6MOTY candidates serve as a symbol of the identity of their teams? Cade of course is the face of our franchise, but the Pistons are currently leading the East because they are the 2nd best defensive team in the league and Stewart is the face of our defense.\n\nISAIAH STEWART FOR NBA SIXTH MAN OF THE YEAR!\n\n",

There are no signs of Ausar becoming a better shooter. He will not even shoot open 3s which kills our spacing. I do not think we can really afford having two nonshooters share the floor. \n\nObtaining a scoring threat next to Cade makes us legit contenders. We would also see Cade's shot selection improve and efficiency rise because he will not be triple teamed anymore. Pacers were able to take the next step by trading for Siakam. I think we will have to do something similar eventually. \n",
