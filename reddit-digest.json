People are going to say whatever they want to say about me, Franz and whoever. But we know that we’re at our strongest when both of us are out there on the floor.\n\n> “People say that the ball moves more (when only one of us is out there). I don’t think that’s true, honestly. I think sometimes you beat teams or you play certain games and it may look that way, but if you really watch and analyze, we play the same way every game. Nothing changes when somebody is out. We play the same way, especially on offense. Nothing really changes. I don’t buy too much into that (perception), but it is frustrating to see that and hear that just because, like I said, we’re at our best when both of us are out there.”",

        "selftext": "Youth players from the local FC appear to have been involved in the serious assault on Duke Barning (21) on November 11 in Den Bosch. The Keuken Kampioen Divisie club says it is \"aware of a case that may involve individuals active in the youth academy.\"\n\nVictim Duke Barning from Oisterwijk told his story last weekend together with his girlfriend Britt Wauben (17) in De Telegraaf, after he was almost kicked to death on the street during the start of carnival.\n\nFor no reason at all, a large group of young men wrestled him to the ground early that evening in Den Bosch and kicked him hard and deliberately at the head. \"That seemed to be their main goal. I had no bruises, even though my head was completely cut open. There was blood everywhere,\" he recalled dejectedly.\n\nHis girlfriend, Britt Wauben, was there and had to watch as her boyfriend was nearly trampled to death. \"I screamed and yelled as loud as I could. Two bystanders finally intervened, and then it stopped. That saved Duke's life,\" said the young finalist of the Miss Teen Brabant pageant.\n\nOn the eleventh of the eleventh, the hospital diagnosed that they kicked a hole into his skull. As the owner of a scooter shop, the twenty-something tried to rebuild his life, but the consequences of the near-fatal assault proved too great six weeks later.\n\nWith frustration in his voice: “I feel very powerless and I can't concentrate on anything.”\n\nDuring a follow-up visit to the doctor last week, it was discovered that the sinuses in his forehead were inflamed. This, the doctor concluded, is also the reason he suffers from constant, severe headaches.\n\nThe fact that the kicking was likely carried out by professional footballers in training makes the incident even worse. Sources at De Telegraaf confirm that the three suspects, arrested last week, are youth players at FC Den Bosch.\n\nThe club has reportedly removed the players from its website. However, an FC Den Bosch spokesperson called this a coincidence. The website was reportedly recently updated and many old portraits were removed. One of the suspects is also said to no longer play for FC Den Bosch.\n\nThe club will first await the outcome of the police investigation. The spokesperson: \"The club currently has no verifiable information indicating the involvement of individuals from the youth academy. If this does prove to be the case, we will discuss it with those involved. Any negative role will have consequences.\"\n\nPolice announced in a press release that two 18-year-olds and one 19-year-old were questioned and released. They remain suspects in the assault.\n\nHowever, multiple suspects were involved in the violence. The prosecutor is considering releasing available camera footage to bring the other suspects into focus.",
