If he does nothing then teams will just get away with it, but turning into a flopper is a horrible alternative too.\n\nNBA needs to address this phenomenon because it's not good for the game. If certain big men mean the rules no longer apply for defenses, it will only encourage more flopping. It's a lose lose\n\nEdit: wanna add that I am not the type of fan who condemns any player for flopping. I have a \"don't hate the player, hate the game\" mentality. It's a league issue. I think players can flop for different reasons but ultimately is a bad product that no one wants to see. However, the league rewards the behavior so I am not gonna hate on any individual for simply trying to take advantage of the exploits and be competitive within the given circumstances and set of rules.",

        "selftext": "FIFA also announced a $1 million (then £924,000) humanitarian donation. “In the face of this conflict, we want to do our part and support the people in Ukraine and the ones who have fled the war,” Infantino said at the time.\n\nYet in an interview with Sky News on Monday, Infantino said “we have to” when asked if he would explore lifting the ban on Russia.\n\n“Definitely,” he added. “Because this ban has not achieved anything, it has just created more frustration and hatred.”\n\nInfantino added that FIFA “should actually never ban any country from playing football because of the acts of their political leaders” while also claiming that allowing boys and girls from Russia to play football elsewhere in Europe “could help” the situation.\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister Sybiha posted on social media: “679 Ukrainian girls and boys will never be able to play football — Russia killed them. And it keeps killing more while moral degenerates suggest lifting bans, despite Russia’s failure to end its war. Future generations will view this as a shame reminiscent of the 1936 Olympics.”\n\nUkraine’s sports minister Matvii Bidnyi also criticized Infantino, saying on social media: “Gianni Infantino’s words sound irresponsible — not to say infantile. They detach football from the reality of children being killed … As long as Russians continue killing Ukrainians and politicising sport, their flag and national symbols have no place among people who respect values such as justice, integrity and fair play.”\n\nBidnyi gave examples of young Ukrainian athletes and sports lovers whose lives had been claimed. He cited the case of  Illia Perezhogin, “a 10th-grade student at a Mariupol school, who was simply playing football at his school stadium when a Russian missile struck.”\n\nHe continued: “Former futsal player Viktoriia Kotliarova was killed together with her mother during the shelling of Kyiv on December 29, 2023. She was a Kyiv Student Futsal Cup champion and a winner of the Dynamo Student League tournament.”\n\nIn a statement, the Ukrainian Football Association (UFA) said they urged FIFA and its president “not to change the position of football authorities on excluding Russians from football competitions while the war against Ukraine continues.”\n\nPosting on Facebook, the UFA said: “Military actions on the territory of Ukraine continue, the situation has not improved, attacks destroy civilian infrastructure and the lives of civilians. Russians continue to attack on the front line. Due to constant attacks of settlements throughout the country, millions of Ukrainians are left without light, water and heat.\n\n“We disagree with the claim that a ban against the aggressor does not work. We believe that suspension from participation in competitions is an effective method of pressure against the aggressor. The potential reintegration of any national team of Russia jeopardizes the security and integrity of the competition.”",
