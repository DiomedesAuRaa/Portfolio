        "selftext": "People know the Big Ten and SEC are looking to expand again between, likely sometime between 2030 and 2035. People say that’s bad for the Big 12 and ACC because their top teams will get raided. But here’s my question: it would certainly be bad for the ACC, but would it really be bad for the Big 12?\n\nWhen I hear about the teams the Power Two might actually be interested in, it’s always the top teams in the ACC and never anyone from the Big 12. There seems to be legitimate interest between both the Big Ten and the SEC and the top four brands from the ACC (Clemson, Florida State, Miami, and North Carolina). Georgia Tech and Virginia seem like longer shots than those four but I’ve even heard there’s potential interest there as well.\n\nHowever, I’ve heard nothing about the Power Two being interested in any Big 12 teams. Texas Tech and Baylor would make sense for the SEC at least geographically, but I see no reason the SEC would want either team unless \\*maybe\\* they somehow lost out on \\*all\\* the top ACC teams to the Big Ten. The only Big 12 teams I’ve even seen tied to the Power Two was an article about the Big Ten potentially wanting Utah, but I think that was the author’s opinion and not an actual rumor. And I think the commenters on that article rightly pointed out that if the Big Ten really wanted Utah, they would have invited them in the first place instead of letting them go to the Big 12. In fact, I think the Big 12 might even benefit from the ACC getting raided by the Power Two because teams like Louisville and Pitt might decide they’re better off in the Big 12 than a watered down ACC without their top brands.\n\nSo while power two expansion will certainly be bad for the ACC, will it be good or bad for the Big 12?",

I actually like the idea of it! But of course it’s lame because of course the players couldn’t give a shit. The funniest thing the NHL could do is institute a complete copycat of the inseason tournament and watch their players take it very seriously and make it VERY meaningful to fans.\n\nFor most of my life NBA was my favorite league with hockey completely off my radar. That’s crept down to about a 60/40 split in favor of nba now. I really don’t know how the nba can fix a single thing if we coddle the players and pretend that treating them fairly means not expecting the bare minimum of them showing up for their jobs.",
