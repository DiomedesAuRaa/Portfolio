        "selftext": "The 7-8-1 Cowboys travel to New York (New Jersey, whatever) to play the 2-13 Giants. They will be obvious favorites coming into the game and will probably win, ending their season at 8-8-1. Being a .500 team during the 17-game era is impressive, but Dallas wouldn’t be the only team to accomplish this feat. Out of the 160 combined team seasons (32 teams \\* 5 years) in the 17-game era, only one team has done this…the [2022 Washington Commanders](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/was/2022.htm?__hstc=213859787.25287edd6fe7f70cc880c0c55da6e55e.1757823419524.1766596011900.1766755846656.33&__hssc=213859787.4.1766755846656&__hsfp=2637335241) who went 8-8-1.\n\nSo yeah…it’s hard to be .500 when the schedule is an odd number of games, and Dallas can be in the 1.2% of teams to ever do this, and that’s pretty cool. But the **PERFECT SEASON** is in play here.\n\n**A perfect season is a .500 winning percentage and a point differential of exactly zero**. (Sorry, Bob Griese, Larry Csonka, and Jim Kiick)\n\n**With a 23-point win over the Giants, Dallas would be one of only two teams in history with a perfect season.**\n\nOut of 2,416 team seasons in NFL/AFL history, only one…ONE team in history has ended at .500 with a 0-point differential, a perfect season. **This feat was accomplished by the** [**1984 Bengals**](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cin/1984.htm?__hstc=213859787.25287edd6fe7f70cc880c0c55da6e55e.1757823419524.1766596011900.1766755846656.33&__hssc=213859787.20.1766755846656&__hsfp=2637335241) coached by Sam Wyche and led by a trio of quarterbacks, Ken Anderson, Turk Schonert, and Boomer Esiason, all with at least three starts.  \n\nAs hard as a perfect season has been in the past, it is orders of magnitude harder today given the 17-game schedule. It requires a tie, which has happened only 0.3% of the time since 2021 in the 17-game schedule era (four ties out of 1,360 games). And of course, the tie must be for an 8-8 team, so the odds dwindle quickly.\n\nAs shitty as the Giants are this year and approaching the potential number one pick in the draft, a big win by Dallas in week eighteen is a reasonable expectation. A 23-point win has happened [216 times in NFL history](https://www.sports-reference.com/stathead/tiny/AE4tF). More recently we have had two this season, five last year, and 8 in 2023. The Giants have yet to lose a game by 23 or more this year (lost by 18 twice), and Dallas has yet to win by 23+ (won by 22), but the final week can bring about some freaky results with resting players, guys mentally checked out, and tanking being in play.  It is also possible that some Cowboys come across this post, realize what's at stake, and *try* for *exactly* \\+23 (Dak, CeeDee…we know your one of us, give us the usernames!)\n\nIf Dallas can pull this off, here are the most likely scores based on the number of occurrences in history:\n\n* 30-7 (47 occurrences)\n* 23-0 (40 occurrences)\n* 37-14 (34 occurrences)\n\nDallas has a chance to be great; to do the almost impossible; to do something only 0.04% of teams have ever done…a Perfect Season. The most disappointing outcome would be a 22- or 24-point-win. Keep an eye on this game on January 4^(th), and tune in during the fourth quarter, because these moments don’t come around often.\n\nHappy Holidays, Happy New Year",

        "selftext": "Okay so earlier this year when Johnny Mo came on he said he wanted to...\n\n\"Hunt for explosives\"\n\nMo is from the school of the Air Coryell system.  It uses geometry to stretch the field wide and deep.\n\nThe issue, to get those chunk plays you need to hold the ball longer.\n\nThis season Lions rank #1 in 40+ yard completions.\n\nThe Ben Johnson likes the Erhart-Perkins system.\n\nThis system is based around simplicity.  Where the play call is very short, and the players run the same route just from different formations.\n\nIt resulted in short to mid range plays.\n\nThe data reveals what happened.\n\n2024 Lions - \nAverage depth to target 7.1 yards.\nAverage depth to target 3rd down 7.4\n\nGoff's pocket time was 2.3s\nPressure to sack 18.2%\nEPA + 0.22\n\nShift to this year\n\n2025 Lions - \n\nAverage depth to target 6.8\nAverage depth to target 3rd down 9.6\n\nGoff's pocket time was 2.6s\nPressure to sack 23.9%\nEPA + 0.18\n\nWhat all this means is, when Goff was throwing, he had to hold onto the ball longer, to allow plays to develop.  The system is reliant on deep routes to stretch the field.\n\nObviously with an interior offensive line made of rookies, 3rd stringers and a journeyman this was a storm waiting to happen.\n\nOne wrinkle to is average sack depth.\n\n2024 - 6.5\n2025 - 7.6\n\nChasing explosives put Goff in a position where he had to do more 7 step drops.  This forced a young offensive line to hold on for longer.\n\nAgain it worked against the personnel we had.  Getting the ball out quick isn't part of this scheme.\n\nAnother interesting thing, that I noticed was rhythm...\n\nLast year it felt like they'd get into a rhythm, which is a halmark of the Erhart-Perkins system.  Shorter plays to get yards to get the team in a rhythm.\n\nWhere this year if we got disrupted chasing chunk plays, we got behind in the count and things became disjointed.\n\nI'm still learning about football and these concepts...\n\nBut it's an interesting look at a few things I felt were off, but couldn't put a finger on it.\n\nEDIT: Added the part about sacks, and updated the average yards per attempt and 3rd down.\n",
