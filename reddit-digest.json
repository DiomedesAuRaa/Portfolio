I’m still not quite there yet, but after watching this I think he should be on the hot seat if he doesn’t show any improvement to finish the year.\n\nIf you’re not familiar with this guys channel, he’s a former high level college coach.  He’s never come out and said where but past comments lead you to believe it was with the Maryland Terrapins.   He’s primarily a Ravens fan but the Lions are his NFC team.  He brings a good professional, outside perspective to the tactical side of games.\n\nHaving never played or been involved with organized football I appreciate how he breaks things down.\n",
