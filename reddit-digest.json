The agreement was signed by Dr. David Cook and me, reflecting shared leadership and continuity as the university moves forward during this transition. This decision follows extensive evaluation and discussion and represents a long term strategy aligned with NDSU’s mission as a student focused, land grant, research university.\n\n \n\nThis move represents the next step in a decade of competitive excellence and careful planning. Athletics visibility is one important part of this transition, but it is not the sole driver. Conference alignment at the FBS level supports broader goals related to enrollment, academic reputation, research partnerships, workforce alignment, and national engagement, while maintaining our commitment to affordability, access, and student success.\n\n \n\nUpdates will continue to be shared as implementation planning progresses.\n\n \n\nThank you for your leadership, care for students and colleagues, and commitment to NDSU. This moment reflects what our people have built together and positions the university to move forward with purpose, collaboration, and confidence.\n\n \n\nGo Bison,\n\n \n\n \n\nRick Berg\n\nInterim President / Office of the President\n\nNORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY",

Here goes a major rant. \n\nCBA - the new CBA has basically ruined basketball for casual fans. People are sick of hearing about it. Takes major effort to understand it. It’s way too restrictive and already has and will continue to gut homegrown teams.  \n\nGambling - a literally coach was fired for sports gambling. The whole situation with Terry Roizer in Miami is basically unacceptable and horrible business practice. Every single hosting platform creates bets surrounding the game. It’s just going to be a continued issue. \n\nAspiration - A team has circumvented the cap and no consequences have occurred. It’s not even talked about and the player the allegations are against didn’t make all star weekend and was INVITED by Adam silver. Do you know how big of a joke that is? \n\nGiannis trade and Kalshi - 23M dollars in bets made on a Giannis trade. Giannis announces a stake the day following the trade deadline. I don’t care if this is allowed. After the gambling scandals to start the year and the aspiration scandal you think it would be enough to step in and say “This shouldn’t happen” but no ADAM SILVER DOESN’T CARE ABOUT THE GAME OR FANS. \n\nAll star weekend - I don’t even need to say anything. \n\nNBA Media -  there’s no real journalism.  Everyone is just a mouth piece for the front offices. Palo completely exposed it. We are about to have an all star weekend where there will be absolutely no hard hitting questions on anything I’ve stated. \n\nI can’t recall a single year where there’s been this many scandals. We can even add the cooper flag pick to this. I’m disgusted by the product and the million streaming platforms I need to have to watch it on. Rant over. ",

Nothing. He walked past them, as our people say – as if past a Turkish cemetery. With a single wave of the hand, without looking, like when he assists his teammates, which the greatest optimists interpreted as a greeting…  \n  \n>And they were waiting, all dressed up, neatly prepared, in traditional costumes that they had carefully prepared, washed, and repaired days in advance especially for this occasion.  \n  \n>And in the end they returned home sad, deprived of a memory they would have cherished for the rest of their lives – to meet a brilliant basketball player, their countryman, whom they admire and for whom they cheer with all their hearts.  \n  \n>Luckily, they were already old enough, so they did not really cry or shed tears, which did happen last year, in the same place, on the same occasion…  \n  \n>Namely, back then, also after a Denver–Chicago game, more than 300 of our children, little ones, waited for over an hour in the arena corridor to meet the MVP, the best in the world. In vain.  \n  \n>Nikola Jokić did not deem it worthy to dedicate five minutes of his time to them.  \n  \n>In the end, another great basketball player, but also a great man, Nikola Vučević, appeared and comforted them, even though he does not play for the Serbian but for the Montenegrin national team.  \n  \n>He came out of the locker room and kindly posed with the children, tossed them some “bones,” talked with them and their parents…\n\nFull article: [https://serbiantimes.info/en/column-kovacevic-nikola-jokic-childrens-tears-and-the-difference-between-a-great-basketball-player-and-a-great-man-video/](https://serbiantimes.info/en/column-kovacevic-nikola-jokic-childrens-tears-and-the-difference-between-a-great-basketball-player-and-a-great-man-video/)",

        "selftext": "Original article: https://ericmintzer.substack.com/p/giannis-kalshi-and-the-death-of-trust\n\n\\> In the week leading up to the NBA trade deadline, Shams reported Giannis Antetokounmpo wanted out of Milwaukee. ESPN promptly named the Miami Heat, New York Knicks, Minnesota Timberwolves, and Golden State Warriors as potential landing spots. Over the next several days, Giannis trade rumors took over the sports news cycle. Major outlets discussed it seriously, debated fits, and framed it as a real possibility. Yet, as the deadline passed, the two-time MVP remained with the Bucks.\n\n\\> Soon after, Giannis announced that he had taken a partial ownership stake in Kalshi, a prediction-market platform that allows users to bet on real-world outcomes. Kalshi hosts prediction markets on sports, politics, and pretty much anything, even the weather. In the weeks leading up to the deadline, roughly $23 million had been placed on Kalshi markets tied to where Giannis would end up.\n\n\\> The situation presents a clear conflict of interest. Giannis publicly allowed trade speculation to build, and millions of dollars flowed into markets, guessing where he might go. When the deadline passed, he stayed in Milwaukee and also held a partial ownership stake in the platform that hosted those bets. Even without proof of intent, the overlap is hard to ignore. Kalshi’s markets visibly shifted in response to news updates and reporting about Giannis throughout the process.\n\n\\> This concern is not theoretical. Over the past year, gambling scandals have erupted across major sports. In the NBA, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups were arrested in an FBI investigation into illegal sports betting schemes involving organized crime. Yes, that Mafia. In college basketball, federal authorities have revealed widespread point-shaving and match-fixing investigations. The scandal involved 39 players and 17 teams. In Major League Baseball, Cleveland Guardians pitcher Emmanuel Clase was federally indicted on charges including wire fraud, bribery, and conspiracy for allegedly rigging pitches in as many as 48 games.\n\n\\> If we can’t trust the news, the markets, or the motives behind the stories we follow, then what are we actually watching? Sports only work if we believe they are real. Giannis did more than test that belief. He broke it. By tying trade speculation to ownership in a prediction market, he crossed a line that sports have treated as a cardinal sin for generations. It dealt a direct blow to fan trust and to the league’s claim of integrity.\n\n\\> Once fans start asking whether outcomes, stories, and speculation are part of the show, the illusion is already gone. Gambling did not blur the line between performance and reality by accident. It made the blur profitable. And once uncertainty itself becomes the product, trust is no longer the foundation of sports. It becomes the wager.",
