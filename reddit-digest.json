Feel free to post your own!\n\nManny Diaz has an ACC title; Mario Cristobal does not.\n\nRyan Day won more playoff games in 2024 than Urban Meyer won his entire career. Likewise, Urban Meyer has more national championships than Ryan Day has wins versus Michigan.  \n\nLane Kiffin has never coached in a playoff game has a head coach. He joins Clay Helton as the only USC head coach to not coach in a playoff or national championship at some point in their career since Paul Hackett.  (Edit: if you include interims, Orgeron has also coached a playoff as a head coach but Williams has not).\n\nScott Frost had more conference losses his final full season with Nebraska than Tom Osborne had in his final 12 seasons. \n\nCurt Cignetti is 26-2 in two seasons at Indiana. As their head coach, he's never lost to a team that didn't play in the national championship. \n\nThe first 4 team playoff featured Bama getting beat by the Big 10 champ in the Sugar Bowl, who would go on to win it all over the Pac 12 champ, while the Pac 12 champ beat FSU in the Rose Bowl, and many said the Big 12 team from Texas had been snubbed.

Its been reported the Mets offer for Tucker was in the same ballpark as LA's, but if the money is even, why not go play where you can win a ring in nice weather and hang out with movie stars? Its like if the Lakers were as stacked as the Thunder, what player wouldn't want to go there?\n\nThey just have every advantage possible, all at the same time, to a degree that really only the most dominant Yankee dynasties of the past ever came close to matching.",

The article talks about how the brothers were beat within an inch of their life and the British justice system according to article decide to punish the following actions:\n\n>A punch was thrown and the pack instinct set in. There was a chase and, finally, a catch. The fleeing Sarfraz had stumbled over the pavement in a street called Mill Hill. Before he could get to his feet he had been set upon, thrown against a dustbin, punched, kicked and beaten senseless.\n\n>Even when he was unconscious, the attack continued. Paul Clifford, from Woodgate’s group, was seen bending down to bite his face and, in Ridsdale’s words, “shake him like a dog with meat in its jaws”. The victim’s father, Muhammed, would talk later about his son’s head being kicked around “like a football”. Shahzad, who was also viciously attacked, witnessed it all.\n\nWith this\n\n>Woodgate would be found guilty of affray, though not the more serious charge of grievous bodily harm. He was spared prison but ordered to undertake 100 hours of community service. Bowyer was cleared of all charges, even though he would later pay £170,000 in an out-of-court settlement to the Najeib brothers (without accepting liability for their injuries). Another Leeds player, Tony Hackworth, was acquitted on the judge’s direction. The prosecution had been unable to prove that anyone bar Clifford, who was jailed for six years, was responsible for Sarfraz’s injuries. And a fourth player, Michael Duberry, was found not guilty on a charge of perverting the course of justice. Duberry had lied in police interviews to cover for Woodgate. Under the weight of his conscience and fearing for his future, he then gave evidence in court against his friend and team-mate.\n\nI will post the full article below as it is behind a paywall",
