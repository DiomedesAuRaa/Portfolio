No big media outlets (cable, print etc) have touched this story. None of the many basketball podcasts I listen to daily (except for a lame “we don’t have the legal understanding to discuss this but recommend you check out pablo’s story” from the athletic’s nba daily).\n\nI get why the aspiration story blew up, and how it directly affects the league and cap circumvention etc. but for this to get no mainstream coverage is wild to me. What am I missing?\n\nAnd btw I’m not asking for some corporate social justice slop from the league. But this is serious and for them to not even acknowledge a report alleging that an owner is defying international law/sanctions is mind boggling to me\n\nEDIT: here is a link to Hunterbrook’s investigation/the allegations I reference above:  [https://hntrbrk.com/ubiquiti/](https://hntrbrk.com/ubiquiti/)",

We have not yet seen his address to the world, but we take these matters very seriously, and we will investigate.” \n\nWhen it comes to the head office, the league are basically lawyers protecting the business interests of _all_ the owners. So not until it becomes embarrassing to other owners will they say anything. \n\nA couple of owners may have no problem with what Pera’s ~~drone~~ company is doing all with the equipment that’s ending up in Russia. \n\nI’ll admit that I didn’t watch the Pablo videos on Pera, but just have the general jist of it. \n\nThough I bet he seems know federal inquiry about violating sanctions against Russia, I bet he gets a call from the White House (and maybe even the Mavericks owners) about violating sanctions against Iran.",

Even Mourinho. Someone had to tell him. Yes come, all to the front.\n\nWhat did Mourinho say before the game? He said, either you kill or you will be killed. Yes, a little martial, no question, but somehow it fits this game.\n\nAursnes- and NOW Trubin is up front. Are we going to crown this drama in the rain of Lisbon?\n\nAursnes- AND THERE IS TRUBIIIIIN. THERE IS TRUBIIIIIN. THERE IS ANATOLIY TRUBIIIIIN.\n\nI CANNOT GRASP IT. I CANNOT GRASP IT.\n\nANATOLIY TRUBIN HEADS BENFICA INTO THE PLAYOFFS OF THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE. AND YOU GUYS CANT SEE THIS.

I’m sure that’s the mindset, but tackling is about getting all the way there, wrapping the guy—thudding the guy, wrapping him—and then you just don’t got to do the extra bring him to the ground, right? Half the time, guys are just in desperation trying to get somebody on the ground where you’re putting yourself and the person who you’re tackling at risk, right? That’s improper tackling technique, but if you’re doing it correctly, you can be in a position where you can tackle and be like, ‘Okay, I ain’t bringing you all the way to the ground.’”",
