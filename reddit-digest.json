Applying those midpoints against Cot's Contracts estimates of 2026 CB tax payroll, I find that total payroll would decrease from $6.12B to $6.07B, or by 1%. That is well within the margin of error for both Cot's estimates and whatever cap and floor is actually proposed: a cap and floor of, say, $155M and $275M would instead be *marginally* payroll accretive.",

You add that to the $412 million and it turns into $602.8 million shed versus $347 million added.  \n\nThere's also the issue that this is the proposal for 2027 and you're using 2025 payroll numbers.  Total payroll has risen close to 4.5% a year over the past 25 years, so if you add two more years on increasing payroll, the numbers would be multiplied by (1.045)^2... or 9.2% higher.

Explains cause of multiple test issues: ‘Abnormal vibrations occurred, causing damage to the battery system.’** \n\n>Aston Martin Honda suffered a disastrous pre-season test. HRC President Watanabe spoke about the causes of the frequent problems. \n\n>Honda Racing Corporation (HRC) held an F1 press briefing. President Koji Watanabe and Managing Director Ikuo Takeishi discussed the current situation regarding Aston Martin Honda's challenging results in pre-season testing.\n\n>With the arrival of Adrian Newey, the completion of a new factory and wind tunnel, and the acquisition of Honda's power unit (PU), expectations are high for Aston Martin in 2026. The unveiling of the new AMR26 machine, with its radical design, further heightened those expectations.\n\n>However, once testing began, the situation was dire. Compared to its rivals, the car completed fewer laps and its lap times were not promising. Furthermore, on the eve of the final day of testing, it suffered battery problems, and on the final day itself, combined with a shortage of parts, it managed only six laps, leaving significant uncertainty ahead of the season opener.\n\n>While the chassis certainly played a part in this predicament, the prevailing view at this stage is undeniably that the Honda power unit bears significant responsibility. Regarding this situation, HRC President Watanabe stated:\n\n>‘Frankly speaking, the pre-season testing proved extremely challenging for us. We were unable to achieve the anticipated performance, and a complex set of issues became apparent.’\n\n>So stated President Watanabe.\n\n>‘This test was an extremely important process in terms of visualising the issues. Our engineers and mechanics are now working more closely than ever with the team on the ground, working day and night to make improvements.’\n\n>‘We are also holding frank discussions with Aston Martin and, more united than ever, are working to find solutions to overcome these difficulties.’\n\n>‘The wall we face is certainly high, but we will not, of course, stop challenging it.’\n\n>Mr Takeishi, Managing Director, further explained this as follows.\n\n>‘During pre-season testing, we observed abnormal vibrations. I believe the main cause was damage to the battery system caused by these abnormal vibrations.’\n\n>‘In response, we are of course investigating the cause on the PU side and intend to take countermeasures. We are also implementing countermeasures on the car side.’\n\n>‘But in terms of what we are actually doing specifically, we are currently using the Sakura bench, a test bench with the monocoque mounted on it, to analyse and implement countermeasures against the vibration.’\n\n>‘The battery system was damaged by abnormal vibrations caused by a combination of factors during running. We are working with Aston Martin to resolve this ahead of the season opener.’\n\n>However, both President Watanabe and Managing Director Takeishi declared that they would implement all possible countermeasures before the opening race. Managing Director Takeishi concluded by saying:\n\n>‘There are various issues, but we will definitely go for the win.’\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)",

        "selftext": "Hey yall,\n\nFreep and DetNews have been reporting on this, but I see that a lot of people are having a hard time dealing with the pay wall. \n\nUltimately, it's not clear if investigators have probable cause to arrest TA... yet. But that may change depending on how the case progresses. \n\nHere's the summary:\n\nTA's rental home was robbed recently. TA's camp suspected that his driver (call him, \"the Driver\") was the culprit. TA's camp reported it to the police. \n\nLater, TA's girlfriend (call her \"the GF\") coordinated with three other people in TA's orbit (together, the \"co-Defendants\") to retaliate. The GF directed one co-Defendant to lure the Driver to an apartment where two others awaited with firearms. When the Driver and the driver's associates arrived, the co-Defendants attacked and robbed the Driver and his associates. \n\nApparently, the GF coordinated everything via a text group chat. It is not clear if TA was in the chat group. \n\nIt does not appear the court order attributes any criminal actions to TA himself. That would explain why he hasn't been arrested - no probable cause yet. Considering all of this was coordinated ***in*** ***writing*** (lol), that's a good sign for TA. \n\nNevertheless, that can change. If one of the co-Defendants orally implicates TA in the conspiracy to kidnap and rob the driver, he will likely be indicted -- and the Lions will probably cut him. \n\nSo far, we do not actually know if TA did anything \"wrong.\" Nothing beyond his alleged relationships to the people involved actually ties him to the alleged crime. Theoretically, this could have happened outside of his knowledge.  Ultimate the State has the burden of proving otherwise. \n\n\\*\\*\\* \n\nWe do know, at the VERY LEAST, that TA needs to exercise much better judgement about the people he associates with. \n\nI really like TA. I've seen him interact with fans at Training camp. Watched his podcast. Seen how Saban talked about him. By all accounts he seems like a really good kid. \n\nIF HE DID conspire to rob the driver, that would strike me as inconsistent with my observations of his character and, tragically, would warrant his dismissal from the team. \n\nBut we aren't there yet. All we can do is wait and see. \n\nThe obvious question is: what does this mean for the Lions?\n\nWell... you CANT assume that TA won't be implicated. ***The team needs to operate under the assumption that one of the co-Defendants will implicate TA in exchange for favorable treatment by the DA***. So even though we don't know if TA will be arrested, they need to treat CB as a need this off-season. ",
