        "selftext": "1.  Miss me with the \"they can't be paid to play\" because they already are being paid to play.  \"Name, image, likeness\" was always just a workaround the rules.  Saying they can't be paid to play is just denying the reality of the situation for a more preferable fiction.\n\n2.  I am so tired of the overwhelming roster turnover.  The pendulum swung way too much in the players favor and harms the stability of teams and their potential growth.  I am especially tired of paying a player for a season only for him to sit out of the bowl game and enter the portal.  I don't blame the player for doing that when he can and it is in his best interest.  But I do blame the system for allowing that to be okay.  It shouldn't be.   \n\n3.  I am also so tired of the constant tampering too.  It's one thing to contact a player once they are in the portal.  It's another that their agents start getting calls in week 4.  \n\n4.  Okay, so it's not a perfect fix, but I propose that NIL contracts need to be (1) for a number of years 2-4 and (2) with a buyout if they decide to enter the portal before it expires.  This would be good for both sides.  If a player excels and jumps in the portal the team that developed him will recoup some of their losses.  Other players will think twice about entering the portal due to a contract that they themselves agreed with.  And they be free to transfer after those years expire without a buy out just like coaches.  But it also provides stability for the player if he does not pan out and he is not just pushed out into the cold.",

According to StubHub, the Terrace Suite number 7 is just section \"7\" not TS7 or T7 or anything like that. So the person that listed the tickets I now have picked \"07\" instead of \"7\", and I'm now in possession of two suite tickets for the Gator Bowl.\n\nI've been in a suite before, but it was definitely all people that knew one another.

It might even kill the visiting team, granted the \"home\" team had the good sense to actually stay home that day.\n\nSome better analogies for a poor defender include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. An unobstructed ureter.\n2. A disenchanted high school teacher who has given up on trying to make a difference.\n3. A broken airport metal detector.\n4. Someone who doesn't understand jokes.\n5. A traffic light where all three lights are green.\n6. A poorly positioned diaphragm.\n7. A priority target for a squad of storm-troopers.\n8. A trust-based low security Danish prison.\n9. A worry-free millennial.\n10. An overactive and scientifically anomalous immune system.\n11. An inanimate carbon rod.\n12. Crotchless boxers.\n13. A Watchmojo top 10 list.\n14. People who use the term 'acronym' when it is clearly an initialism.\n15. James Harden.\n16. An understudy fluffer who's been suddenly called into active duty.\n17. Someone who always misses their flight.\n18. Flattened villi from undiagnosed celiac disease.\n19. A Ben Shapiro video essay.\n20. Someone who had love, but didn't realize it until it was too late.\n21. Someone who doesn't know what to do with their hands when having a casual in-person conversation with someone they just met at a work-mandated social gathering.\n\nSo in closing, please be more careful with your analogies, and the next time someone calls YOU a black hole on defense, take it as a compliment and offer to expertly secure their balls like every black hole would.",

        "selftext": "Explanations for the first few picks:\n\n17) Kadyn Proctor, OT\n\nProctor is a physical demon who isn't 100% refined but could ideally redshirt partially under Taylor Decker and build up a bit more technique. With some development he could genuinely become the next Mailata. If Decker retires this offseason, Proctor could still serve as a plug-and-play starter, especially since he's experienced protecting the blind side. In any case, I think the Lions draft the best OT available here, and maybe even trade up a pick or two for Fano or Mauigoa if they're available at spot 15-17.\n\n50) Connor Lew, C\n\nI have a sneaking suspicion that the Lions will either sign a major center or EDGE rusher in the offseason. And since teams are more reluctant to let their OL players go, I'm projecting they maybe sign Bosa or Hendrickson (if they want to splurge) and then draft a dedicated player at center. Lew is likely the best C in the draft and his presence would allow Tate Ratledge to remain RG where he's most comfortable.\n\n118) Jacob Rodriguez, LB\n\nRodriguez has had a massive hype jump this year, showing great versatility and intelligence as a LB. With Anzalone likely leaving this offseason, despite a pretty deep LB room, the Lions could benefit from another major playmaker alongside Jack Campbell. Honestly, I'd be surprised if he fell this far but would be elated if we could scoop him up here.\n\n134) Anthony Lucas, EDGE\n\nEven when healthy, the Lions' defense has struggled with pass rush all season, with a revolving door of practice squad players opposite Hutchinson. Lucas will hopefully remedy this inconsistency, with a big build that appeals to the Lions' defensive scheme and great physical traits. Plus, he's injury prone, so Brad Holmes will love him!\n\n156) Xavier Scott, S\n\nWith Branch likely out for the majority of next season and Joseph with a lingering bum knee, the Lions' secondary will be rough next year. While a fifth-rounder isn't going to remedy that on his own, Scott is a pretty versatile DB with experience both in the slot and as a safety. Depending on personnel strengths and which FAs the team decides to resign, Scott could fill a couple of roles on the back end.\n\nLet me know what picks you'd like the team to make next year!",
