        "selftext": "[This season](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/s/51pSmGZcU1), Mendoza threw for 41 TD’s, for an average of about 2.56 per game. If you adjust this average to just 2 per game, he goes from 41 TD’s to 32 across his 16-game season. I’ll be generous and give him 35.\n\nNow let’s adjust his passer rating. **It goes from 182.9 to 177.69 just from adjusting his touchdowns to slightly above 2 per game. Later on, I will adjust further to take yards into account.**\n\nNext, we have to account for his passing yards per attempt being higher than average. He has an average of a flukey 9.3 yards per attempt this season. If we adjust this to 8 ypa, which is still 0.9 yards higher than the mean, he goes from have 3,535 passing yards to just 3,032 passing yards on the season.\n\nNow, I will adjust his passer rating again based on these newly adjusted stats.\n\nAfter this, his passer rating ends up at 166.54.\n\nHis final 16-games adjusted stats:\n\n• **3,032 yards / 379 attempts / 273 completions / 72% completion (same) / 35 touchdowns / 6 INT (same) / 8 Y/A / 166.54 rate**\n\n# What does this tell us?\n\nIt tells us that Mendoza’s perceived success in college is largely inflated by unsustainable, wildly outlier stats in his 16 games as perceived elite talent. When you adjust by bringing down his outlier stats, he heavily regresses to a slightly above average college QB.",

In nearly every other esport if a team starts playing a certain way then there’s a plethora of options through weapons, skills, abilities, or even map functionality to counter it.

I am looking to trade this jersey for another item of potentially similar or greater value. I am doing this to help raise awareness for frontotemporal dementia. my dad passed away from FTD when I was 14 years old he had a genetic variant of the C9 gene which causes FTD or ALS. My goal in this project is not only to raise funding and awareness but connect with others who are impacted by dementia, grief, loss or genetic illnesses along the way.
