I was 1000% into mlb at that age, & I learned so much about the history of baseball & it's greatest players & stadiums through playing this game & looking info up in encyclopedias that I would pick up through playing. It let you simulate seasons & I think I got my love of tracking / learning statistics through this game, I had a binder where I would manually keep track of all kinds of stats & standings as I played. I created custom players using baseball card stats or newspaper stats & I sunk countless hours into this game. \n        \nI know I continued playing it for a few years & enjoyed it so much & I think it helped make me into the sports fan I am today.

And while I’d love for that to be the case, our goal should be winning a playoff series and continuing to mature into a contending team. We have a lot to learn, which makes sense for where we are in the process. I think we’re ahead of schedule, which is great. Enjoy the ride, which includes growing pains like today!",
