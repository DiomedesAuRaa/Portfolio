        "selftext": "Hello and happy holidays to everyone on r/baseball. I hope you and your loved ones all had a wholesome and very merry Christmas. Now let's talk about freaky sex.\n\nThis is a ranking of how likely it is that a team name might be spoken, shouted, moaned, whispered, or otherwise vocalized during a sexual interaction. For the purposes of this list, \"sex\" includes everything that might possibly fall under a very broad umbrella of sexual interactions which I am not going to attempt to circumscribe or define here, EXCEPT to note that post-coital intimacy is explicitly not included -- otherwise, statements such as \"do you think the Brewers game is still on?\" would be in play.\n\nFor the purposes of these rankings, I am using the team's official name in its entirety as stated on [mlb.com](http://mlb.com/), and no short versions or nicknames. This means we are only considering the Blue Jays and not the \"Jays\" or (so help me) \"BJs.\" And before Toronto fans complain too much, please understand that otherwise the A's and O's would absolutely run away with this one.\n\nHowever, I am allowing both the singular (\"f\\*\\*k me like a Brewer!\") and the plural (\"this is even better than when that group of Brewers f\\*\\*ked me last night!\"). And since we are only considering the spoken word I am allowing homophones as well, which should come as a delight to the small-but-vocal segment of Philadelphia fans who are weirdly insistent that their team is named after young female horses.\n\nRelatedly, I am allowing situations where the team name is said as part of a larger word or phrase. Which is potentially important news for anyone who spontaneously sings \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" at the moment of climax, but probably more important for teams such as the Astros and Reds.\n\nAs always, these rankings are just for fun, and in no way reflect my feelings vis-a-vis these teams, their players, their ownership, or their fans. Nor do these rankings necessarily reflect my sexual interests, proclivities, or experiences as a cisgendered heterosexual man. If you feel I am overlooking a situation feel free to note it in the comments, but for the love of God please do NOT share your personal sexual anecdotes here. This is not r/Economics.\n\nSince a disappointing number of you never bothers to read these rules anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and wrap up the foreplay and get on with the action.\n\n**Tier One -- Perhaps As a Safety Word**\n\n**30: Arizona Diamondbacks**\n\n**29: Washington Nationals**\n\n**28: Toronto Blue Jays**\n\n**27: Baltimore Orioles** \\-- The ranking of these four is more or less arbitrary, but for what it's worth I think \"Oriole\" would make a great safety word. And for a variety of reasons which I will not describe in detail, it is better if a safety word is not too long and does not include any sounds such as \"b\" or \"t\" which might require you to be able to close your mouth or bring your teeth together.\n\n**Tier Two --** ***Les Adjectifs de L'Amour***\n\n**26: Los Angeles Dodgers** \\-- Look, this is a judgment-free zone. Sometimes discretion is the better part of valor.\n\n**25: Atlanta Braves** \\-- \"It was so brave of you not to say 'oriole' when I \\[\\*\\*\\*\\*\\] that \\[\\*\\*\\*\\*\\] in your \\[\\*\\*\\*\\*\\].\"\n\n**24:** (I'm still calling them the Oakland) **Athletics** \\-- Several possibilities here, including commentary on how athletic one might be in dodging that object or substance.\n\n**Tier Three -- There's No Wrong Way to Roleplay, But ...**\n\n**23: Milwaukee Brewers** \\-- Presuming that you are not having sex with Brewer Hicklen.\n\n**22: Texas Rangers** \\-- Cowboys/cowgirls/cow-nonbinaries are a fairly common fantasy. Maybe people fantasize about rangers as well, but it seems rather less likely to me.\n\n**21: Seattle Mariners** \\-- I won't argue much if you think the Rangers and Mariners should switch spots. But just think of the possibilities if MLB had had the good sense to name the team the \"Seattle Sailors\" instead.\n\n**20: Cleveland Guardians** \\-- Numbers 21-23 represent unusual but otherwise fine forms of roleplay. This one represents a much different form of problematic roleplay. And that's all we need to say about that.\n\n**Tier Four -- Where Should I Insert This** (Giggity)\n\n**19: Kansas City Royals** \\-- The Royals juuuuuust fall out of the weird-roleplay group. If they were named the Kings, fuhgettaboutit, right up to the front of the line. But does anyone call anyone else \"royal\" during sex? \"Oh baby, you do that so royally\" -- just doesn't sound right. But \"royal\" just happens to have a vowel combination that sounds like something someone might moan. (Go ahead, give it a try, just double-check that no one's within earshot first). So between that and however likely it might be that someone might like to be called Royal Something-or-other during sex, I'm putting it here.\n\n**18: New York Mets** \\-- No one is likely to say \"met\" as such during sex; but consider all the other things they might say: \"Oh my God, I'm so glad I met you in this Denny's restroom!\" \"No, not the furry ones, the metal ones!\" So on and so forth.\n\n**Tier Five -- The Sexual Dynamics of Hosiery**\n\n**17: Boston Red Sox** \\-- \"Oh yeah, Tina, you look so hot in those red socks.\"\n\n**16: Chicago White Sox** \\-- \"For God's sake, Allen, I'm not doing this if you don't at least take off those white socks.\"\n\n**Tier Six -- Sexy Nicknames**\n\n**15: Chicago Cubs** \\-- I'm just going to assume that there is a subset of the gay community for which this term is applied. Or failing that, perhaps someone with a speech impediment might say \"I'm gonna cub!\" \n\n**14: New York Yankees** \\-- Without delving unnecessarily into personal anecdotes, I will just say from personal experience that if you happen to be from anywhere geographically or culturally north of the Mason-Dixon Line and you share an intimate moment with someone from the other side of said line, there's a decent chance that you will hear this. Most likely being shouted at you, with a few vulgarities sprinkled in.\n\n**13: Philadelphia Phillies** \\-- A good one to come back with right after she calls you a damn dirty Yankee.\n\n**12: Detroit Tigers** \\-- Now we're drawing blood.\n\n**Tier Seven -- Roleplaying of the Less Esoteric and/or Horrifying Kind**\n\n**11: Pittsburgh Pirates** \\-- Yar, here comes me plank to shiver yer timbers and take that booty! Those of you who enjoy a jolly roger know who you are.\n\n**10: St. Louis Cardinals**\n\n**9: San Diego Padres** \\-- Religion is a common fetish, and nuns and priests are very commonly sexualized and feature in the fantasies of many a current or former Catholic. \"Padre\" seems rather more likely than \"cardinal,\" but the latter cannot be entirely ruled out. And no, I'm not going to consider any other possible sexual situations for either of these team names.\n\n**Tier Eight -- Regular-Ass People's Names**\n\n**8: Miami Marlins**\n\n**7: Tampa Bay Rays**\n\n**6: Colorado Rockies** \\-- Mostly a yawn here, but an inarguably common yawn, as saying someone's name during sex is both frequent and a good way to start a fight if said name is not accurate. But to paraphrase *When Harry Met Sally*, who's having good sex with someone named \"Ray\" or \"Marlin\"? \"Do me, Marlin.\" \"Slap my ass, Ray.\" \"I wish you'd stop saying 'oriole' so quickly, Marlin.\" No offense to anyone named Ray or Marlin. At least \"Rocky\" might be part of a boxing fantasy or something.\n\n**Tier Nine -- A Hodgepodge of Specific (But Foreseeable) Situations**\n\n**5: Minnesota Twins** \\-- \"So I was thinking \\*pant\\* that maybe one time \\*pant\\* we could do this with you and your twin...\" \"Shut up, Allen.\" \n\n**4: Houston Astros** \\-- This is the most important case for my \"it can be a part of a larger word or phrase\" rule, as \"astro\" just happens to be the prefix of a very popular brand of personal lubricant. And also maybe someone wants to engage in a little *Jetsons* roleplay. Ruh-roh.\n\n**3: San Francisco Giants** \\-- Oh, settle down. Lots of things can be giant in the bedroom. \"I'm trying to switch positions, but I can't because of your giant body pillow!\" \"You have a giant blackhead on your back!\" So on and so forth.\n\n**2: Cincinnati Reds** \\-- Much like the Giants, \"red\" can describe a lot of things, from Tina's red socks, to Allen's red pillowcase, to spanking Naomi's ass red, to Jorge shouting \"oriole\" before his ass gets any redder.\n\n**Tier Ten -- It Was Always Going to be the Angels**\n\n**1: The Angels of Whatever Place They Are From Now** \\-- I honestly tried to think of a more creative winner for these rankings, but much like Andrelton Simmons in his prime, \"angel\" just covers too much territory for anything to sneak by. It can be a man's name. It can be a woman's name. It can be a nickname. It can be a roleplaying fantasy. You might ask your partner to move their angel doll out of the way. It could even be a safe word if for some reason \"oriole\" hasn't yet occurred to you.\n\nAnd thus the Angels win their [second consecutive MLB ranking](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1ptadsd/ranking_the_mlb_teams_according_to_how_difficult/), thereby conclusively demonstrating that the league's competitive safeguards are nonfunctional and baseball is ruined. See you all in 2026.",

Kawhi reminded us old guys he's a HOFer and showed the young guys.\n\nWhat gets me is when he was just lighting up Tobias for the whole first half where was the adjustment?\n\nDid the Pistons double team him to get the ball out of his hands? No.  \nDid they sub Tobias out for younger more athletic guys like Ron or Ausar? No.  \n  \nNope they let him just blow up.   \n  \nBut surely in the second half there would be a change of some kind right? No. Tobias was on him.  \n  \nWhen did they double team him? In the 4th quarter when they were down 14!  \n  \nCuz I guess it was okay to lose the game but they didn't want him to get the all time single game scoring record?   \n\nI'm not saying the double team would have changed much. But here's what I do know.\n\nWhen any great player comes out hot you've got to try and stop him right away! Because when he sees that ball go in 3-4 times! He's feeling confident!\n\nNope Pistons let him get 40 before they doubled.  \n\nTo me that's crazy! Like I said probably a loss anyway. But when you look at that lineup, who besides a Hot Kawhi are you afraid of? Double Kawhi, keep someone on the Beard and let 97 year old Brooke Lopez try to beat you! \n\nThey doubled Cade, slowed him down. \n\nMy 2 cents. Am I crazy? ",
