So he just saw our friend die in front of his eyes - and that's it.\"\n\nThe matter of fact way in which Sudan forward John Mano recounts the death of his best friend Medo is at odds with the intense look burning in his eyes as he does so. \n\nMedo is one of more than 150,000 people to have been killed during the country's civil war which began in April 2023.\n\nMano, who debuted for the national team just months before the conflict started, says Medo had travelled to the city of Wadi Halfa, near the border with Egypt, to arrange documentation to leave the country during what the United Nations is calling the world's largest humanitarian crisis.\n\n\"I think they forgot some certificates,\" the 24-year-old tells BBC Sport Africa, speaking at the team's hotel at the ongoing 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Morocco.\n\n\"It was so important for the family and he had to go back. He went to his house and took everything.\n\n\"They caught him. They said, 'Are you working with the army?' He just wanted to explain. But they started shooting him.\"\n\n# 'I cannot forget this until I die'\n\nThe power struggle between Sudan's army and a paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Force (RSF), has also forced more than 12 million people to flee their homes, with widespread famine and reports of genocide in the western Darfur region.\n\nUnsurprisingly, football has taken a back seat. Stadiums have been destroyed and the league halted.\n\nTwo of the country's biggest club sides, Al Hilal and Al Merrikh, are currently playing in the Rwandan league, having spent last season in the Mauritanian top flight.\n\n\"We don't have a league, we don't have anything, but we can't complain because people in my country, they can't eat, they don't have food,\" says Mano.\n\nBut despite all the challenges - including having to play their home Afcon qualifying matches in neutral countries - [Sudan have reached the finals](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn9xpx797x5o) for only the fourth time since 1976.\n\nGhanaian head coach Kwesi Appiah has had to convince players to compete without guarantees of payment and has offered consolation on \"several occasions\" when squad members have lost family members.\n\n\"We try to let players know, even though they're gone, \\[they're\\] looking at you and what you can do now for the nation,\" says the 65-year-old, who took charge in September 2023.\n\n\"I need to give the player maybe two or three days off, to make sure he comes back to himself.\"\n\nSome of the players have not been home in years, with many lucky enough to find a new club overseas.\n\nLike several others in the Falcons of Jediane squad, Mano has made the move to Libya, first joining Al Ahly and now Al Akhdar.\n\nBut the former Al Hilal man did not escape Sudan before experiencing a death threat of his own.\n\n\"The rebels used to stop us and make fun of us on the road,\" he explains.\n\n\"They'd say things like 'You play for Al Hilal - what is Al Hilal? I support Al Merrikh. I can kill you right now and nobody will question me'.\n\n\"I cannot forget this story until I die.\"\n\nAppiah and Sudan captain Bakhit Khamis say part of their role has been creating a family feeling within the squad.\n\n\"Football is the only relief we have as Sudanese people,\" says left-back Khamis, who also currently plays in Libya.\n\n\"It is the only thing that can make us happy and help us forget the pain and suffering we \\[have been\\] through during the period of war.\n\n\"The feeling of unity becomes part of you, you cannot avoid it. Our goal has become stronger - Sudan first, Sudan above everything.\n\n\"This unity is one of the best things that has happened to us. It was able to make us united as one people.\"\n\nAppiah aims to make players feel they can be \"the best in the world\" with the right attitude, inspiring his team to a memorable home win in Libya [over Ghana](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c7813dgy0mro) \\- the country he won the 1982 Afcon with as a player and later managed twice - during their qualifying campaign.\n\nWhen an ambassadorial delegation arrived at the team hotel after the game, the squad discovered that soldiers back in Sudan were celebrating the result.\n\n\"At least for one day, they put their guns down,\" says Appiah, hoping that the war will \"cease totally\" to allow \"everybody to come back home happily\".\n\n\"I believe that, if by grace we are able to win it (Afcon), you never know.\"\n\nWhile hoping the soldiers lay down their guns permanently, Mano describes football as a \"weapon\" to \"fight for my country\".\n\nHe is promising the fans back home that the 1970 champions will battle all the way in Morocco.\n\n\"Some of them (the fans), they can't watch the match, you know that? Not even on the radio, they can't hear.\n\n\"Every day people \\[are\\] dying.\n\n\"We're trying to free our country the football way.\"\n\n[Source.](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cm2vjy3gvl1o)  \n",

He deserves everything in coaching that comes to him. I love having him on our staff. Jernaro makes our team better every day.”\n\n... “BYU is so blessed to have a man like G. who has been there for nine years,” Daniel said. “He should be there for the next 20.”\n\n... “G is the most valuable (assistant) coach at BYU, and it is not close,” Daniel told the Deseret News last month before graduation. “If you want to make some people angry, put that (comment) in the paper. If you want to talk about value, it is not close. That man is so, so valuable to BYU.\n\n“The way he recruits, the way players look up to him, the way they think about him, is (legitimate),” Daniel continued. “Look at the way they respect his word, the way he cares about them. The way he takes time to have those little conversations with them.”\n\n... “With (Gilford), it isn’t always about football. It is the way he talks to them about school, about what the guys are doing off the field. He invites guys over to his house to eat all the time. He is the most valuable guy in the building, and it ain’t close.”\n\n... “The way he treated me when I came in was tremendous,” Daniel said. “You want to talk about a man with no ego, a man who knows what it takes to build a program and know what it is all about, that’s Jernaro. … I came in as a guy who had just retired from playing. He could have said, ‘Just sit there, don’t say much.’ Not Jernaro. He’s not afraid of this or that, of losing his job.”\n",

This season, I say we make some noise and push Isaiah Stewart to be in the 6MOTY conversation.\n\nThe idea came to me when Stew won Eastern Conerence Defensive Player of the Month despite playing off the bench and earning just over 20 mins a game. I know that 6MOTY is almost always rewarded to subs who bring instant offensive firepower. But the prominent names in the sixth man talk right now are not really running away with it. Ajay Mitchell, Naz Reid, and Keldon Johnson are averaging just 3 to 4 ppg more than Stew. NAW's name comes up in some lists, but he has more games as a starter than a sub so he should not be considered.\n\nStew has bigger impact as a sub even if his contribution offensively is not huge. Which of the other 6MOTY candidates serve as a symbol of the identity of their teams? Cade of course is the face of our franchise, but the Pistons are currently leading the East because they are the 2nd best defensive team in the league and Stewart is the face of our defense.\n\nISAIAH STEWART FOR NBA SIXTH MAN OF THE YEAR!\n\n",

We would also see Cade's shot selection improve and efficiency rise because he will not be triple teamed anymore. Pacers were able to take the next step by trading for Siakam.
