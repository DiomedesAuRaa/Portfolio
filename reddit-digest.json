Thank you to everyone who has supported me on this journey the best is still ahead.\"\n\nIn early December, Hausmann explained that he departed the program and the country after an unfortunate experience with U-M staff member.\n\n\"This is why I left America,\" wrote Hausmann. \"You tell one staff member about an experience I had with my faith. An experience where I was trying to figure out what was going on, still knowing I was in season. So I thought it would be smart to talk to someone. So I go to the building where I spend most of my calendar year, the football facility. I thought I would receive guidance and clarity, as it was a life-changing experience. After hearing what I had to say, I got put in the category of a mental patient who is going to end their life.

        "selftext": "Hey folks, can we collectively agree to NOT crash out today?\n\nLet’s roll into this game with expectations so low they’re basically doing the limbo under the door. There’s literally nothing on the line except maybe pride and a participation trophy. This is a glorified preseason game wearing a regular-season costume—don’t be fooled.\n\nToday’s matchup features our elite offensive line (missing) and our fearsome defense (also missing). I’m not expecting much. Like, “participation ribbon” levels of much.\n\nNeither should you.\n\nSo please, for the love of whatever coping mechanism you’ve got lined up for the offseason, do NOT let this game ruin your day. Save the meltdown for something that actually matters\n\nChill. Grab snacks. Laugh at the absurdity. We’ll all still be here tomorrow, slightly more dead inside, but alive",
