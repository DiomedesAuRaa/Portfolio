Rather, his body absorbed the burst appendix, cleaned up the inflammation, and went on about its business. “I didn’t have surgery or anything. I stayed in the hospital for like two days and then started to feel fine again,” he says. “The nurses kept calling me ‘Chuck Norris’ because they’d never seen anything like it.”",

The fan section leaders have informed all members who occupy that area that tomorrow the club is asking them not to boo the Real Madrid players, not to join the rest of the stadium when the players are booed. \n\n> Not only should they not boo, but they should applaud and cheer on the players. The leaders of the fan section, who, let us remember, are in direct contact with the club, suggest to their members that anyone who wants to show their anger should do so outside the stadium, outside the Bernabéu, and that anyone who wants to do so inside has time to give up their season ticket to avoid a problem. \n\n> There will also be control over the flags and messages displayed in the background. Grada Fans warns its members that flags from the different fan clubs located in that area will not be used, only their own, more generic Grada Fans flags, which will be handed out at the entrance to the match.\n\n> It is important to note that there are security cameras in that area that the club monitors. Grada Fans knows that anyone who breaks these rules tomorrow is taking a risk; in other words, if you boo, you may not be allowed back. There are 1,800 fans who occupy this privileged position for around €500 per year, and we are aware that in recent hours there has been debate and anticipation in the WhatsApp groups of fans in that area, the South Stand of the Santiago Bernabéu, about what will happen tomorrow.",

I don’t want that either. But this isn’t 2K.\n\nDetroit probably isn’t landing a goto perimeter scorer through free agency, and they aren’t getting one by stapling together role players and late first round picks. If you seriously want someone who slots in as a reliable No. 2 option next to Cade, it’s going to take selling high on someone with real league-wide value.\n\nAusur comes to mind. He’s already one of the most versatile defenders in the league, and he’s a big reason this team is competitive.\n\nIt’s also obvious we need more consistent perimeter scoring to give Cade and Duren room to operate, and maybe that makes Ausur a luxury.\n\nHonestly, if you make a Venn diagram of what Beef Stew and Holland bring (pros & cons) that overlap starts to look a little like Ausar: hustle defender, active hands, positional flexibility, athleticism… but very limited offense outside the break.\n\nThe clock is ticking too. Cade’s already on the max. Duren’s next deal could get expensive fast. If Ausar keeps trending up, he’s going to cost too. Once those deals stack up, there will have to be sacrifices somewhere.\n\n(EDIT: I should note again that I am not saying that we blow up the core. I just think a lot of the expectations on getting a Pippen on this team for Tobias's expiring, Ivey and some picks is absurd. I'd rather we make some moves around the edges until the salary cap forces the team to make bigger moves. But if you wanted to make a big move, Ausur is how to get it done, that's all.)",
