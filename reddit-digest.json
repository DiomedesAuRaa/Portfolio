        "selftext": "Throughout F1 history, we're told that you can only be compared against your teammate. A true enough statement, yes, but there are times when the raw numbers don't accurately reflect how well a certain driver did against their teammate. Here are some examples.\n\n**Vergne beating Ricciardo in 2012:** Now admittedly, this one isn't black and white (in fact very few of these examples are) but Vergne did outscore Ricciardo by six points in 2012. However Ricciardo did have more points finishes, albeit he never reached Vergne's peak of 8th throughout the season (2012 was a great year, but Toro Rosso were by far the slowest team that wasn't Caterham, Marussia or HRT).\n\nIn terms of race pace, both drivers were roughly even, but Ricciardo smashed Vergne in qualifying. Vergne was eliminated in Q1 so many times, him and all the backmarker teams were all declared \"the usual suspects\" and it honestly made Q1 in 2012 really boring. Ricciardo made a stunning 6th in Bahrain qualifying, yet Vergne never made Q3 once.\n\nI can see arguments to be made that Vergne was better in 2012, he arguably had the slight edge in race trim, but I do believe Ricciardo just had the slightest edge on him.\n\n**Kvyat beating Ricciardo in 2015:** Compared to Vergne, Kvyat beating Ricciardo is the far more egrigious example when it comes to drivers beating their teammate, despite not being better than them. It pains me inside every time I read that Kvyat was a match for Ricciardo, because that is only true if you look at the final drivers' standings, and nothing else.\n\nThe reason why Kvyat finished ahead of Ricciardo in the standings was because Ricciardo had far worse luck in terms of reliability, and being crashed into, when the car was at its strongest. In race pace and qualifying pace, Ricciardo was far stronger.\n\nTake the 2015 Hungarian Grand Prix. Kvyat finished second, and Ricciardo third, but that was because Kvyat survived the the demoltion derby that was the 2015 Hungarian Grand Prix. Ricciardo likely would've won the race if Mercedes decided not to bash him out of the way.\n\n**Rosberg beating Hamilton in 2016:** Ooh, this one has the potential to drown me in boiling water. Yes, Roseberg did beat Hamilton to the title in 2016, and was easily his best year as teammates. But was he really the quicker? Sort of?\n\nHamilton did have more raw pace than Rosberg, in both race pace and qualifying, but two things let him down that year. The first was that he was terrible off the starting line. Hamilton lost so many points in 2016 due to him constantly getting off the line badly in 2016.\n\nAnother thing that was outside of Hamilton's control, was his bad look with accidents and reliability. In the second race of the season, Bottas decided to play bowling against Hamilton, rather than with him, and in the following two races, Hamilton would suffer reliability problems in Q3, granting Rosberg pole position. Malaysia was a race that Hamilton was on to win easily, before his engine died on him. Something the wise and extremely trustworthy Helmut Marko credits to \"Verstappen/Ricciardo putting Lewis under pressure, which caused him to panic, and make him break his own engine.\"\n\nRosberg's bad luck was nowhere near as strong in 2016, and in the end, Hamilton only lost the title by five points. I'm glad that Rosberg got to be world champion, but I wouldn't declare him to be the best driver that year.\n\n**Kubica beating Russell in 2019:** This one is pretty obvious. Kubica only beat Russel twice throughout the season. It just so happens that one of those times was a race where enough cars retired/penalised for a Williams to score a point. Russell otherwise dominated Kubica.\n\nBut looking back at Russell's Williams career, he was so close to being beaten by Latifi as well. Had Russell not moved to Mercedes to replace a COVID Hamilton, Latifi would've beaten him in the standings. Had Belgium 2021 been dry, Latifi would've beaten him in the standings.\n\n**~~Schumacher beating Mazepin in 2021:~~** ~~A true talent was wrongfully overlooked in 2021. Just because Mazepin had a few dozen spins, and was sometimes seconds off the pace, people declared him the worst driver of the 2020s. Have you not seen Drive to Survive? He beat his teammate by using his knowledg of Russian clouds to his advantage.~~\n\n**Sainz beating Leclerc in 2021:** Sainz does have have advantages in comparison to Leclerc, his biggest one being is that he's intelligent enough to navigate his way around Ferrari's shenanigans. That being said, He was rarely a match for Leclerc's raw speed.\n\nYes Sainz got four podiums in comparison to Leclerc's one, but only one of those podiums was down to his raw pace (that being Abu Dhabi of all things). Two of the three podiums came from him crazy races in which Leclerc lost out to from no fault of his own, and Monaco was a race where Leclerc had pole position but ended up not starting the race.\n\nLeclerc was easily the faster of the two Ferraris when it came to the more standard races where there was little to no chance of scoring enormous points. Indeed there were races such as Turkey and Spain where Leclerc was leagues ahead of every other midfield runner. Sadly those races didn't have much happen that would've granted him a podium.",

        "selftext": "[Source 2](https://xcancel.com/NickMiller79/status/2018976936224317534#m)\n\nGuardiola is such an intense, obsessive man that it’s sometimes easy to think of him being hyper-focused on football, only vaguely aware of the outside world. So it’s always interesting when he reminds us, semi-regularly, that he isn’t.\n\nMaybe it’s unfair to criticise those managers who don’t speak on other things: lord knows, you can’t excessively blame someone for seeking a quiet life, and it doesn’t help to harangue people for not speaking about topics they’re not well versed enough in.\n\nGuardiola should be lauded for speaking up, but there is a spectre hanging over this, and something that is inevitably brought up whenever he says anything of this nature. Ultimately, Guardiola works for Abu Dhabi. You’ll either know all about this already, or you can do your own research, but for the sake of brevity, we can just say here that it’s a state whose Amnesty International page makes for pretty spicy reading.\n\nIt’s undoubtedly not great that Guardiola, a man with a moral compass, has been happy to work for his Abu Dhabi bosses for almost a decade. His position has been basically ironclad for most of that time, so he is in a strong position to speak up against the dictatorship of his ultimate employers.\n\nHis answers on this topic in the past have been unsatisfactory, to say the least. In 2018, after he was fined by the Football Association for wearing a yellow ribbon in support of Catalan independence, he was asked by the journalist Rob Harris about the conditions and lack of democracy in Abu Dhabi. “Every country decides the way they want to live for themselves,” he replied.\n\nDoes it represent moral cowardice, or unpleasant inconsistency, to speak mainly about things that aren’t likely to present any tangible consequences for him? Maybe. Probably. But there’s inconsistency everywhere. Most people are inconsistent. Most people have probably had moments of moral cowardice. Should that preclude us from talking about moral issues? I would say no.\n\nIt would be better, preferable, great even, if Guardiola did speak out against Abu Dhabi. But he’s speaking about something. He’s speaking about Palestine, about Sudan, about ICE, and for someone in his position to do that is welcome. The rest doesn’t negate that.",
