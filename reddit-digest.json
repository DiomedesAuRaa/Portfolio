We have good RB depth, but Beck likes to rotate RB's more than any other OC we have had. Moa has the ability to play more positions than the other two, and like Hiter it's an early enrollee. With that being said Moa and Hiter obviously have much better chance to be the most impactful out of those three. I personally think that Moa might have a slight edge due to the amount of positions he can play. I guess we will see!",

Well done.  \n\nIf you were around for the online mess of the 00s you know that Zach set a new standard when he came in at the end of that decade just by saying “here’s this thing, here are video examples of this thing, I talked to coaches about this thing, here’s why I like it or don’t like it” in a world of eye test vs weak numbers.  He introduced a new level of civility to the Wild West like Wyatt Earp and he’s respected because of that.\n\nZach’s mediocre now, he’s like David Letterman in the 00s, phoning it in, and like Dave we love him for it what he used to be back when he had a spark but, like late night in the 00s, mediocre is enough to keep the viewership because oh my god have you seen the others.",
