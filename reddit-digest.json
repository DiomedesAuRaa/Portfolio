        "selftext": "It's not clear when Jeanie learned about the promise between JoAnn and her father, but when she spoke over the phone with Jesse on that 2019 call, in what multiple sources with knowledge of it say marked a sharp pivot from the topic of the Davis news conference, she brought it up.\n\n\n\nGiven that promise between her mother and father, Jeanie told Jesse, \"You should've never been born.\"\n\n\n\nJesse processed the words, according to the three people briefed on the call.\n\n\n\n\"You should've never been born.\"\n\n\n\nThe words echoed in more ways than one. There had always been distance between the four older and the two younger siblings -- and not just because of the pronounced age gap, with 31 years separating the oldest (Johnny) and youngest (Jesse). The older siblings often said that their father was frequently absent during their childhoods and that his empire was built by the time Joey and Jesse were born.\n\n\n\n\"When Joey and Jesse arrived, watching my dad and the joyful part of fatherhood and watching him engage with them, it reminded me of the things that he missed when I was growing up,\" Jeanie said in the 2022 Hulu series.\n\n\n\nNews of Jeanie's comments on the call with Jesse soon made the rounds within the organization and to Joey.\n\n\n\n\"It's mind-blowing that she would say that,\" said someone on the team who became aware of the remarks. \"I don't care who you are. You don't say that to somebody else.\"\n\n\n\nSaid another: \"Why would that ever get thrown into somebody's face? I don't know.\"\n\n\n\nOf Jeanie's alleged remark to Jesse, Janie said, \"I can't imagine my sister saying that, but that was the truth. They \\[Jerry and JoAnn\\] did have an understanding.\"\n\n\n\nAn obvious but ominous dynamic had revealed itself from that call, people close to the family told ESPN -- the remark was perhaps a sign of something more, a deep-rooted resentment that for decades had lingered.\n\n\n\n\"That,\" someone close to the family said, \"was the beginning of the end.\"\n\n\n\nIN THE YEARS since, multiple team sources said they sensed Jeanie's priorities beginning to shift. The organization took significant criticism over how it was being run, and she often took it personally, those close to her said.\n\n\n\nWhen external critics called the organization cheap, they were calling her cheap. When critics questioned why she listened to Linda and Kurt Rambis, they were questioning her judgment. When Pelinka came under public fire for the team's roster construction, she took barbs for standing by him. She was quick to label critics as wrong, cruel and biased.\n\n\n\nShe tightened her circle. She grew more suspicious of leaks. She crafted her public image -- and narrative -- through favorable media coverage. \"She's PR savvy, and she utilizes it,\" a team member said. \"She prioritizes that.\"\n\n\n\nShe also came to be known in some circles for turning against those who were close to her and dear to the franchise. She had done so to Jerry West. She had done so to her brother Jim.\n\n\n\nAnd team sources tell ESPN she even began to turn against the Lakers' star player, LeBron James.\n\n\n\nJeanie privately grumbled, people close to the team say, about what she felt was James' outsized ego and the overt control that he and Klutch Sports, which represents both James and Anthony Davis, exerted over the organization at times.\n\n\n\nShe didn't like that James was considered a savior for a foundering franchise when he arrived in 2018 and that it was he who chose the Lakers rather than the team's leadership receiving praise for landing him. Team sources have been adamant for years that James' camp informed the Lakers as early as 2017 that he was coming to join them when he became a free agent the following year.\n\n\n\nThe distance between Jeanie and James widened after the Lakers traded for Russell Westbrook in July 2021, people close to the team said. The team had made the trade in an effort to appease James, but the acquisition backfired in catastrophic fashion. L.A. went 33-49 and missed the playoffs, and James seemed to wash his hands of his role in the acquisition.\n\n\n\nJeanie privately bristled about what she felt was his lack of accountability and the way James would shift blame onto others after the Westbrook trade, the people said.\n\n\n\nIn 2022, in the aftermath of the Westbrook trade, multiple people said Jeanie privately mused about not giving James a contract extension and, later that year, even about trading James, with the LA Clippers floated as a possibility. (This was before James received a no-trade clause in July 2024 after signing a new two-year, $104 million contract.)\n\n\n\nAnd when the Lakers drafted James' son Bronny with the 55th pick in the 2024 draft, Jeanie privately remarked that James should be grateful for such a gesture, but she felt that he wasn't, people close to the team told ESPN.\n\n\n\nThat summer, as she discussed a new contract for James, Jeanie seemed more resigned to the fact that they'd have to do it -- almost begrudgingly accepting that they'd take a massive PR hit by not doing so.\n\n\n\nUnder Jeanie's leadership, the team had been through years of dysfunction -- of distrust, increasing isolation and discord -- and then, there was the on-court product.\n\n\n\nThe Lakers had missed the playoffs twice in 34 seasons under Jerry Buss; by spring 2024, they had missed the playoffs seven times in the 11 seasons since.\n\n\n\nThey had won 10 titles under Buss; they had won one since. They had posted the NBA's best winning percentage under Buss; they had posted the 26th-best since.\n\n\n\nSince the team moved from Minneapolis to Los Angeles, seven of the team's 11 worst seasons in terms of winning percentage -- including the four worst -- had all come since Buss died and Jeanie took over.\n\n\n\nSource: [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\\_/id/47594947/inside-jeanie-jerry-buss-family-infighting-drove-10b-sale-los-angeles-lakers-mark-walter](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/47594947/inside-jeanie-jerry-buss-family-infighting-drove-10b-sale-los-angeles-lakers-mark-walter)",

        "selftext": "Over the course of last weekend, an X account with 1.5 million followers that purports to offer “unrivalled football coverage” and is blue-tick verified (and thus able to monetise their posts) posted five times about Marseille striker [Mason Greenwood](https://inews.co.uk/topic/mason-greenwood?ico=in-line_link).\n\n“How much longer can Thomas Tuchel ignore Mason Greenwood?” read one, with the statement written all in capitals – it got 3.3 million views. Other lines: “Thomas Tuchel, are you watching?!”, “Arguably the most in-form English player there is (plus 12 exclamation marks)”. They then posted a survey about Greenwood being in the England squad.\n\nWhen Marseille manager Roberto De Zerbi described Greenwood as worthy of the Ballon D’Or – hyperbolic before you consider everything else – football journalist Fabrizio Romano mocked up a photo of Greenwood receiving the award from De Zerbi on Instagram to his 41.5 million followers. His post was tagged as from “Marseille, France”.\n\nAnother X account, this time with only tens of thousands of followers (also blue-tick verified), falsely attributed a quote to England manager Thomas Tuchel: “I would rather lose without him than win with him.” That post was seen 3.4 million views. \n\nThis is merely a sample. This Greenwood stanning has created its own corner of football social media and recently that corner has become increasingly noisy. Over recent weeks, I’ve noticed a significant increase in pro-Greenwood posts on X alone.\n\nThe posts about him typically generate high engagement, particularly those who champion the player for a place in England’s World Cup squad. They are thus a goldmine for those who wish to monetise through engagement. Perhaps they are all simply big Ligue 1 supporters with no idea of the context. Perhaps. \n\nFor those who need to be reminded, Greenwood has not been picked for any England squad since being suspended by Manchester United in January 2022 following the player’s arrest after images and videos were posted on social media reporting sexual and physical violence. In February 2023, the Crown Prosecution Service discontinued the charges after “the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light”. [Greenwood denied all charges](https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/mason-greenwood-leave-man-utd-six-month-investigation-2561869?ico=in-line_link).\n\nA Nigerian Youtuber, whose bio lists him as a Fifa accredited photo journalist, with almost a million followers on X posted: “I love how Marseille is promoting Greenwood” with a fire emoji. One of the top replies discusses how “failure has made him even better”, as if this is an issue purely of missed chances or hamstring injuries. \n\nSocial media is a wild west of opinion and there are those who believe that Greenwood deserves another chance with England. That is bleakly dispiriting. The Oxford Dictionary word of the year is “rage bait”, content deliberately designed, posted or phrased to provoke anger, and that is another theory. Do those running these accounts believe in Greenwood’s cause or are they simply producing content designed to provocate?\n\nWhat the “second chance” implorers fail to appreciate – deliberately or otherwise – is that playing for Marseille, with a manager who is seemingly happy to praise the football to the hilt in public (which I also find grim) [*is* the second chance](https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/barcelona-real-madrid-mason-greenwood-form-exit-3287214?ico=in-line_link). Being picked for your country is a privilege, not a right based entirely upon on-pitch form. Tuchel said in September that Greenwood was not under consideration for selection. Good on him for that.\n\nMuch of this strikes as a playground of aggressive toxic masculinity, reflected in the below-the-line arguments of those who insist that it is Greenwood who is being made a victim through his omission from England’s squads. That is highly depressing given the images and videos allegedly containing Greenwood we saw.\n\nAfter an internal investigation using material not in the public domain and speaking to people involved in the case, Manchester United said they were “satisfied that Mason did not commit the acts he was charged with” but “Mason accepted that he had made mistakes”.\n\nIt’s one thing to call for his inclusion without detailing the history that may form the backbone of the argument against it. Single posts and replies are distasteful, distraction through omission of the key details for why Greenwood left England for Getafe and Marseille in the first place.\n\nBut a concerted campaign over time? That is morally abhorrent and I believe it deserves great censure. Social media is not compulsory; your posts are a choice and, if you have a million followers or more, it comes with responsibility because of the broad range of your audience. \n\nTrumpeting the international hopes of this player is a flagrant breach of that moral code. You should know what you’re doing and you should know what impact it may have on people. You cannot say “hey, this is just a football thing” when the complexities of this situation demand better. There is a duty of care that extends beyond one bloke, an England squad and your engagement metrics on social media.",

        "selftext": "As a Cardinals fan really into Xs and Os, I'm here to tell you why I think your team made a slam dunk hire. You'll hear a lot of noise about your new OC from Cardinals fans - that he sucks, he doesn't know how to use players correctly, that he doesn't know offense. I think they're all wrong. And if I can't convince you of that, I can at least give you some insight as to what you're getting with Drew Petzing. Also gotta mention, [I called this shit in advance.](https://np.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1q5wevz/comment/ny36kw3/?utm_name=AZCardinals) \n\n**Note about AI:** I always get accused of writing with AI any time I write a post like this. I'm not fuckin' using AI. I have never used AI for a Reddit post, not once. Run my shit through an AI detector if you don't believe me. I have a degree in writing, AI and I have been trained on the same shit. But I'm not using AI. \n\n####An innovator of 13 personnel\n\nSean McVay gets a whole lot of credit for implementing a scheme that uses 13-personnel a whole lot, and getting explosive passing plays out of them. The idea is simple - defenses match 12 with a big nickel personnel nowadays, but still match 13 with base. And three linebackers just leaves you susceptible in the pass game, even if opposing offenses go heavy - modern tight ends are too fast and athletic for a base defense to hold up. It may surprise you to learn - Drew Petzing was doing this first. Last season, the Cardinals ran 13 personnel at the second highest rate in the NFL, second only to the Steelers. And unlike the Steelers, who were awful at it, [**the Drew Petzing offense ranked first in EPA when in 13 personnel.**](https://i.imgur.com/nMAYL7g.png)\n\nIn fact, of all meaningful personnel groupings (10% of team snaps or greater) Petzing's passing offense out of 13 was the second best group in the league, with an astronomical **0.56 EPA per play**. Only the Bucs' 21 personnel was better. It's hard to overstate how impressive that is. The Cardinals ran 13 personnel more than 30 other teams, and were the very best at it. It's a copycat league, and scheme is stolen, not invented. Petzing gave McVay a first-hand look at how effective offenses can be passing out of heavy personnel. Petzing absolutely destroyed the Rams in 2024 with 12 and 13 personnel. It's no surprise why McVay would go on to use these looks the following season.\n\n[Here's a big touchdown play.](https://i.imgur.com/0SBMh0r.png) The Rams come out in base, matching the Cardinals three tight ends. 87, the blocking, big boy tight end lines up as the sole outside receiver. The Rams are running a quarters coverage. The ball is not going to the offense's right, but the Rams have a dropping corner and a safety to that side. It makes the left side completely outleveraged. On the left, you have a sail concept. Every team runs Sail, every defense practices guarding Sail. What makes it work is how you dress it up, and calling it at the right time. 2nd and 8 where the Rams want to keep a shell over the offense but in base personnel is makes this work. With the weak side defenders occupied by a single blocking tight end, you have two defensive backs against a McBride deep out and a Marvin Harrison Jr go ball. The linebackers are a non-factor. They're occupied by the shallow route, and they're not quick enough to disrupt the verticality of McBride's route. All the QB has to do is read the strong side safety. The safety I have circled jumps on the out route, meaning MHJ has a one-on-one in the endzone with a step on his man. [Six.](https://i.imgur.com/2hStRMO.png)  \n\n[Here's another example of how Petzing schemes up 13.](https://i.imgur.com/wPyq0IO.png) Coming into this game, the Cardinals ranked 1st in passing EPA vs. base defense, while the Bears defense ranked first in defensive EPA in base. It was a strength vs. strength matchup, and the Cardinals blew the Bears out. What made 13 so effective for the Cardinals was the variety of play action Petzing ran. Petzing, coming from the Kubiak-Stefanski tree, is a master of play action, perfect for Jared Goff. In this play, you have TE Elijah Higgins, running a intermediate crosser. He gets wide open because the LB that's supposed to disrupt his route is completely bamboozled. A Sam linebacker's key in the run game is the opposite side guard. The right guard here pulls across the formation, [which makes #57 hellbent on replacing his DE who's about to eat the block. The other two LBs bite on the run fake as well.](https://i.imgur.com/CFMFWnH.png) To me, this demonstrates such a thorough understanding of offense. Where a linebacker's keys are, how they'll react to a pulling guard, and how to get linebackers stepping up to fill the run. And what you get is a [wide open receiver](https://imgur.com/sIdvKsc).  \n\n####The run game\n\nWith Drew Petzing, you get a lot of familiar looks that most every team runs. Sail, flood, levels, mesh. But he's very very good at mixing them up and calling them at the right time to exploit the defense he's up against. He's particularly good at running them all out of the same formation, the same formation that a lot of run plays come from. It's a well-disguised system. The crux of it is playing a lot of tight ends tight to the formation, forcing defenses to condense as they respect the threat of the run, and exploiting the space they leave behind. So naturally, none of that is possible without a good run game.\n\nPetzing calls a very diverse run game. He majors in the body-on-body, downhill gap scheme kind of stuff that rewards a strong, patient runner. He loves to pull a guard. He'll do this at every opportunity. [Notice how similar this run looks to play-action of the play above.](https://imgur.com/PCNKAFY) Because the backers are slow to trigger on this run, LT Paris Johnson Jr. has the chance to [throw his guy to the ground](https://imgur.com/v0Q26Yt) and [still get a block on the middle linebacker.](https://imgur.com/MoYSFhX) It's pretty easy to imagine Penei Sewell thriving at this role. The success of this 1Q play perfectly disguises the previous 4Q play. The run punishes the LBs for not triggering fast enough, the play-action punishes them for overcompensating and triggering too quickly.\n\n[Here's](https://np.reddit.com/r/AZCardinals/comments/1fj5tuy/victory_lap_for_the_drew_petzing_truthers/) a much longer post I wrote about the diverse gap scheme Petzing gets into. It's all pretty sound stuff and springs all kinds of big plays. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention all the fun whams and split blocks he calls with his tight ends. It's a tough defense to play as a D-lineman. You think you're unblocked, and then boom, you're in the dirt. [Watch #87 here.](https://x.com/Nate_Tice/status/1868717763998667126). It doesn't always work, but Petzing is willing to put all these weird blocks on tape that'll get defenses overthinking. [Here's one](https://youtu.be/Dc_OmKuwSZU?si=VsCcHcMgbPVDhPRd&t=11) where McBride puts in a really weak block that gets the play blown up. Not a good play, but it will serve to disguise a route later in the game when McBride runs across the formation.\n\nLast season, the Cardinals run game ranked **5th in EPA/rush**. 6th in overall success rate. 4th in early down success rate, early down EPA/play, and early down EPA/rush. Last season Drew Petzing called what was inarguably a top 5 run game. With journeymen at LG and C and backups at RG and RT. The only big money player on the O-line was Jonah Williams at RT, who suffered a season ending injury in Week 1. \n\n####2025 and beyond\n\nThe offense took a big ol' shit in 2025, that part is undeniable. But I truly don't think the playcalling was anywhere near the biggest culprit, or even bad. By far the biggest problem was the front office. The GM brought in ZERO offensive players in the draft and free agency. Every pick and dime was spent on defensive players. Petzing was dealt a raw deal. Both the RG and RT coming back from season ending injuries were clearly old and washed. \n\nThe lack of reinforcements reared its ugly head when the franchise LT went on IR, the journeyman LG missed time for personal reasons (child nearly stillborn), James Conner, Trey Benson, Emari Demarcado, Bam Knight all got injured at one point or another. Throw in Kyler Murray who had one of the highest sack rates in the league while throwing deep less than almost every other QB (an issue that was mysteriously solved when backup Jacoby Brissett started playing - clearly not the result of playcalling). This offense was unworkable.\n\n####TL;DR:\n\nI think it's important to remember that only last year, Drew Petzing called a top 10 offense with a top 5 run game. That his 13 personnel passing game has been studied all around the NFL. He's done it before and he can do it again. I think Drew Petzing is a really good hire. As someone that has *actually* studied this man's playcalling.",
