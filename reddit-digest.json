Applying those midpoints against Cot's Contracts estimates of 2026 CB tax payroll, I find that total payroll would decrease from $6.12B to $6.07B, or by 1%. That is well within the margin of error for both Cot's estimates and whatever cap and floor is actually proposed: a cap and floor of, say, $155M and $275M would instead be *marginally* payroll accretive.",

You add that to the $412 million and it turns into $602.8 million shed versus $347 million added.  \n\nThere's also the issue that this is the proposal for 2027 and you're using 2025 payroll numbers.  Total payroll has risen close to 4.5% a year over the past 25 years, so if you add two more years on increasing payroll, the numbers would be multiplied by (1.045)^2... or 9.2% higher.

They build something up, leave and then come back in starting from square one. Whether it's AM's fault or theirs is beside the point.\n\nIt's not just in F1 either. Here in North America, they constantly threatened to leave IndyCar for years before extending very recently.",

Explains cause of multiple test issues: ‘Abnormal vibrations occurred, causing damage to the battery system.’** \n\n>Aston Martin Honda suffered a disastrous pre-season test. HRC President Watanabe spoke about the causes of the frequent problems. \n\n>Honda Racing Corporation (HRC) held an F1 press briefing. President Koji Watanabe and Managing Director Ikuo Takeishi discussed the current situation regarding Aston Martin Honda's challenging results in pre-season testing.\n\n>With the arrival of Adrian Newey, the completion of a new factory and wind tunnel, and the acquisition of Honda's power unit (PU), expectations are high for Aston Martin in 2026. The unveiling of the new AMR26 machine, with its radical design, further heightened those expectations.\n\n>However, once testing began, the situation was dire. Compared to its rivals, the car completed fewer laps and its lap times were not promising. Furthermore, on the eve of the final day of testing, it suffered battery problems, and on the final day itself, combined with a shortage of parts, it managed only six laps, leaving significant uncertainty ahead of the season opener.\n\n>While the chassis certainly played a part in this predicament, the prevailing view at this stage is undeniably that the Honda power unit bears significant responsibility. Regarding this situation, HRC President Watanabe stated:\n\n>‘Frankly speaking, the pre-season testing proved extremely challenging for us. We were unable to achieve the anticipated performance, and a complex set of issues became apparent.’\n\n>So stated President Watanabe.\n\n>‘This test was an extremely important process in terms of visualising the issues. Our engineers and mechanics are now working more closely than ever with the team on the ground, working day and night to make improvements.’\n\n>‘We are also holding frank discussions with Aston Martin and, more united than ever, are working to find solutions to overcome these difficulties.’\n\n>‘The wall we face is certainly high, but we will not, of course, stop challenging it.’\n\n>Mr Takeishi, Managing Director, further explained this as follows.\n\n>‘During pre-season testing, we observed abnormal vibrations. I believe the main cause was damage to the battery system caused by these abnormal vibrations.’\n\n>‘In response, we are of course investigating the cause on the PU side and intend to take countermeasures. We are also implementing countermeasures on the car side.’\n\n>‘But in terms of what we are actually doing specifically, we are currently using the Sakura bench, a test bench with the monocoque mounted on it, to analyse and implement countermeasures against the vibration.’\n\n>‘The battery system was damaged by abnormal vibrations caused by a combination of factors during running. We are working with Aston Martin to resolve this ahead of the season opener.’\n\n>However, both President Watanabe and Managing Director Takeishi declared that they would implement all possible countermeasures before the opening race. Managing Director Takeishi concluded by saying:\n\n>‘There are various issues, but we will definitely go for the win.’\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)",

        "selftext": "The Pistons are currently leading in the regular season standings. If the team sustains this until the end of the regular season and they do not manage a 1st round series win, I most likely would be disappointed. But if they do not win the championship, I really won't be disappointed at all. There is just no historical precedent of an NBA team whose leaders, the team's top 2, go from zero playoff series wins to champion in a season.\n\n~~Tim Duncan led the Spurs to the championship as a rookie in 1998-99 so he technically had no prior playoff series wins. But he was partnered with the Admiral who already had multiple playoff series wins under his belt at the time.~~ EDIT: Timmy was actually a sophomore when they won and he already had a playoff series win against the Suns.\n\nThe Pistons are currently led by Cade and Duren, with zero playoff series wins in their name. If they lead the Pistons to a championship this season, it would literally be a miracle. It is folly to set expectations based on miracles. That said,  I would gladly enjoy the experience if they do something historic. :p",

It just doesn't feel natural when listening, its hard to pinpoint exactly... \n\nLike I care way less about Bill making wild or even off-base claims or takes because it just feels like a natural random convo he's having with a buddy, and his ability to do that draws out more natural and interesting reactions from his guests which elevates the pod overall, whereas other podcasters just feel like they're making points based on agreed upon outline that they came up with in a pre production meeting.
