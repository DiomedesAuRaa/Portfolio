His lack of rebounding has also been a pretty consistent problem since he's been back, and that's amplified by the fact that our starting center, who we expected to be averaging 10 boards as a baseline, also doesn't want to grab boards. It's weird to say but he's not capable of carrying the shitty roster around him anymore. It's very stark when the defense collapses on him and he can no longer muscle his way through. This was kind of similar to early last season when he just wasn't there against Phoenix.\n\nI think a lot of these problems can still be covered up really well if we had a good roster, good spacing, good rebounders. It's the same with Luka's 'inefficiency' this season. But we don't, at least not this season, not right now.",

Even Mourinho. Someone had to tell him. Yes come, all to the front.\n\nWhat did Mourinho say before the game? He said, either you kill or you will be killed. Yes, a little martial, no question, but somehow it fits this game.\n\nAursnes- and NOW Trubin is up front. Are we going to crown this drama in the rain of Lisbon?\n\nAursnes- AND THERE IS TRUBIIIIIN. THERE IS TRUBIIIIIN. THERE IS ANATOLIY TRUBIIIIIN.\n\nI CANNOT GRASP IT. I CANNOT GRASP IT.\n\nANATOLIY TRUBIN HEADS BENFICA INTO THE PLAYOFFS OF THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE. AND YOU GUYS CANT SEE THIS.
