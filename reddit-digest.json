Touching down on the subject in the latest episode of the \"Big Podcast with Shaq\", the Diesel had one of the greatest NBA scorers, Carmelo Anthony, as his guest.\n\n\"I'm not in the GOAT conversation. Listen, it's only three people in the greatest of all time conversation. Listen, I'm arrogant, but I'm not dumb. It's Kobe, Bron, and Mike, okay, that's it. We all have our subcategories… Like, I always wanted to be Lion King. But to me, like I had to modify what I was saying,\" stated Shaq, who never understood why Kobe wasn't in the mix.\n\n\"But my thing is, if you're going to have the conversation, have the correct conversation. For so long, it was just Mike and Bron.And now I'm like,'Oh, I understand the great picks. What about the Kobster?'\" added the seven-footer, making a case for his former Lakers teammate.\n\nAlthough Shaq has on multiple occasions in the past crowned Michael Jordan as the ultimate GOAT, he did propose a new framework for the debate.\n\nShaq's only prerequisite \n\nUnlike many other NBA veterans, O'Neal did not mind revisiting the greatest of all time conversation now and then, but had only one simple rule.\n\n\"I think they should always keep it categorical… the best center, the best forward, the best guard, the best shooting guard.. Can't compare a big man to a guard. Can't do it,\" said Shaq.\n\nInterestingly, O'Neal felt the big guys, who formed a small fraction, were always at a disadvantage. His reasoning behind it was that fans always liked the guards and the little guy more, as it was comparatively easier to relate to them.\n\n  \nSource: [https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/im-arrogant-im-not-dumb-171600571.html](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/im-arrogant-im-not-dumb-171600571.html)",

I also know people hate that his brothers are on his coaching staff but Harbaugh also had a son on his staff who was an absolute beast of a coach for us so that aspect doesn’t bother me as long as they are good coaches.\n\nI think while he’s not my first pick nor is he a perfect candidate I’d be curious to see what he could do with our level of talent and a high level DC.\n\nIdk just some of my thoughts but wanna hear your guys’ thoughts!

And then he didn't. The emotions I felt in that minute were some other shit. Will never forget how dirty they did us here.\n\n  \nHe is the shining light on this team idgaf. Yeah maybe if he could run instead of grounding passes on dead plays we would have some more yards, but fuck all that. He is the GOAT of this team rn. The most important cog in the machine. The glue guy. The reason our pass game is Top 3 in yards and Offense is Top 2 in points scored despite the record. Whatever you want to call him.\n\n  \nI just really really really hope OUR YEAR is a year where he is at the helm. He deserves it. There goes my hero.",
