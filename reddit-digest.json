        "title": "Why Indiana actually went 3-9, NOT 16-0.",

        "selftext": "So as we all know, the Indiana Hoosiers just went 16-0 to win their first national title in school history. However, in this post I'll break down why that is actually impossible and they actually went 3-9.\n\n1. Indiana's first 3 games were against FCS teams. So let's say they didn't play any of them, and instead played actually COMPETETIVE teams. Well, who knows what would have happened? So, we can automatically mark those down as losses.\n2. Their Big 10 Opener was against Illinois, who put up an atrocious performance against them, losing 63-10. However, we can ALSO pencil that one down as a loss. Why? Because the next week, Fernando Mendoza lead a game winning drive against Iowa, and won 20-15. We all know game winning drives are pure luck, not skill, so that is technically a loss. But as a Nebraska fan, I refuse to give Iowa a win in this situation, so instead I will give it to Illinois.\n3. Indiana is now 1-4 walking into Eugene against Oregon, where they win 30-20. However, that one is also a loss because Oregon was ranked #3 at the time, so for Indiana to win that, that would mean they were at minimum a #2 team that night. #2 teams have national championship hopes, however 4 loss teams don't. So it just wouldn't make sense for Indiana to win that one. 1-5.\n4. Then they play Michigan State, who put up the second best performance against Indiana as an unranked team. But, actually it's the best performance they put up, because we already marked Iowa as a loss, remember? And if your a team putting up the best performance against someone who's 1-5 as an unranked team, that pretty much means a win right? So now, Indiana is 1-6.\n5. Then they blew out UCLA 56-6, but that wouldn't really make a whole lotta sense, because UCLA was on a 3 game win streak, just having upset #2 Penn State. Therefore, it wouldn't be logical for UCLA to end all that momentum against a 1-6 team. Indiana's 1-7.\n6. Then the very next week, they play @ Maryland who they blew out 55-10. That's only because Indiana was motivated and had a lot of momentum with their fraudulent wins, you can only imagine they wouldn't have that much motivation as a 1-7 team. So we can count that as a one possession win for Indiana. BUT, since it was AT Maryland, Maryland got that home field advantage, so that means a loss for the Hoosiers.\n7. Then Indiana played Penn State which they won out of pure luck. This is because that crazy catch on that game winning drive was improbable, because what if there was just a slight gust of wind, and blew the receiver just a few inches to the side? Wouldn't had been a catch, and instead out of bounds, so Indiana would have lost. 1-9.\n8. The next 2 games we can count as wins, because as a Nebraska fan I can't give Wisconsin a win, and according to my perfect algorithm, Purdue was the worst team in the Big 10 and Indiana was the 2nd worst team, so Purdue would have lost.\n9. A 3-9 team obviously can't make the conference championship or the playoffs, so all those extra wins disappear.\n\nAnd there you have it folks, the perfect and most logical explanation for how Indiana's season should have went.",

And that’s the real problem. \n\nHave whatever opinion you want of the new autobid rules: the rot is much deeper than that. A committee of financially invested parties is insane and ripe for corruption. \n\nAnd the rot was obvious this year. No not because Miami jumped Notre Dame - as silly as the way it happened might’ve been it at least fit their stated rules. No the rot was obvious with Alabama jumping Notre Dame and staying there. \n\nWe all know what we saw: Bama struggle to beat a losing record Auburn team and jump a ND that sailed to victory. Maybe a rational actor could’ve had Bama higher before those games but nothing in them suggested Bama should rise. The inescapable conclusion is that the committee rigged the rankings last year. And that’s ignoring them ignoring the blowout loss to Georgia. \n\nSolution: Bring back the computers. They’re objective. They can’t be rigged. Or bring back the AP Poll. It’s much harder to rig and does not have concentrated financial stakes in the rankings. But the committee cannot be trusted. They will for better or worse make sure the rankings help the Big Ten and SEC make money at the expense of fairness. ",

By the time I got to UCLA, I had already seen enough to know that staying quiet would not protect me or anyone who looked like me. I had watched cities burn after Dr. King’s assassination. I had seen the bodies. I had heard the grief. I had lived the fear. Speaking up wasn’t a choice. It was the only honest response.\"\n\n>\n\n>\"I remember boycotting the 1968 Olympics and being told I was un‑American, ungrateful, disrespectful to my country. But I knew what I had seen. Dr. King had been killed that spring. The summer before, Newark burned for five days, Detroit for eight. People told me to stay quiet, to just play basketball. And I had to decide whether to accept the story being told about me or to trust my own eyes.\n\n>Back then, we didn’t have cameras in every pocket. We had each other’s testimony. We had the bodies. We had the burned buildings, the charred remains of rage and fear. The truth was written into the world around us.\n\n>That’s the thread connecting 1968 to Minneapolis today. When you demand accountability, the system tries to turn you into the problem. Institutions question your motives, your patriotism, even your right to speak. It’s a distraction, a smokescreen. (Or, in this case, a gas screen.) Because nothing says “law and order” like hurling pepper spray and noxious gas, and refusing to investigate your own questionable or downright illegal actions.\"\n\n>\n\n>\"My father used to tell me that we don’t get to choose whether hard things happen. We only get to choose how we respond. Right now, the people of Minneapolis are choosing to stand up, to bear witness, to refuse silence. I say we stand with them.\"",

For those who want a summary:\n\nGrizzlies Owner Robert Pera has his entire networth ($30b) tied to his company, Ubiquiti, that sells WiFi equipment.\n\nThis WiFi equipment is showing up on the frontlines of the Ukraine-Russia war in shocking numbers. Alleged that 80% of Russia's communication network on the frontline relies on these devices. The video has pictures, video, and Russian soldiers on telegram begging for donations like twitch streamers so they can buy more.\n\nRussia is under sanctions, so it should be strictly illegal to sell devices like this to them. His company got in trouble for doing the exact same thing in 2014 when his devices started showing up in Iran, and the US Government fined them $500k, small because it was a first time offense. Grizzlies Owner said if this happened again, he'd be fucked.\n\nIn the video, they show how easy it is for Ubiquiti devices to be bought from third party sellers in Russia. Ubiquiti has basically no sales team of its own, it relies on these third party sellers and washes their hands clean of wherever they might end up. This is one way to cut your costs, have no compliance officers.\n\nThey even talk to an american third party seller, and pose as a Russian trying to buy $80k worth of devices. They set them up with the transaction, by sending them to Turkey first, then Russia. This is blatant sanctions violation, like a textbook example.\n\nVideo ends with Pablo Torres asking if Adam Silver is fining Ja Morant for holding a gun, what should he do with the Grizzlies owner who's evading sanctions (allegedly) making millions off the war in Ukraine while on Team Russia.",

        "selftext": "A country where safety is under threat from federal violence on the streets is not fit to stage soccer’s showpiece event\n\nRemoving the United States as co-host of the 2026 World Cup would hurt for pretty much everyone. Fans would miss out on seeing the sport’s pinnacle in their home towns (or somewhere nearby). Cities and businesses small and large would lose the financial benefits they had banked on. It would be a logistical and political nightmare on an international scale, the likes of which have never been seen before in sports. It would be eminently sad. And it would be entirely justified.\n\nIt brings me no pleasure to say this. The United States has been eager to host a men’s World Cup for more than a decade and a half. The desire survived and even grew after 2010’s failure to out-bid Russia and Qatar (in public and behind closed doors) for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. With hosting rights for 2026 later secured alongside Canada and Mexico, the US soccer scene prepared to show off that the sport is now part of the nation’s fabric, 32 years after hosting the tournament for the first time in 1994. Soccer’s growing popularity in America has helped inspire other US sports to try new formats, encouraged us to engage more fully with the world in a sporting context, and has been at the center of conversations about our society and culture. The 2026 World Cup was seen as the best chance for the world to fully experience not just how much the US has improved at soccer, but how much soccer has improved the US.\n\nI have not been immune to this Pollyannaish outlook. Much of my career covering American soccer has been predicated on the idea that the sport will continue to grow in the US. The 2026 World Cup is central to that hope. I can admit that I have a vested interest in this tournament’s success. As a lifelong fan, the World Cup landing here was a dream come true. As a professional, I hoped it would create millions of new North American soccer fans who will want to read and watch and listen to journalism about the sport for the rest of their lives.\n\nPerhaps I was naive. The tournament may create some of those fans, but at what cost? Exorbitant ticket prices have cut out the game’s grassroots. Onerous demands on cities have siphoned public money. Fifa has boosted an openly corrupt administration at every turn. Now wanton federal violence has made it difficult to justify having the World Cup here at all. Safety, justice, freedom, the continued functioning of society – these are all under threat. Even to many soccer fans in the US, the game once called “the most important of the least important things” now seems just plain unimportant.\n\nFederal agents have killed two innocent people in Minneapolis in the last three weeks. Neither was threatening the paramilitary forces who shot them. We know these things because we have seen them play out on video after sickening video, from multiple angles, slowed down and refocused and analysed. Yet the most senior governmental figures want us to believe that Renee Good and Alex Pretti were “domestic terrorists”. That they were, in fact the aggressors – in cold contrast to the mountain of available evidence. It would be reasonable to assume that those who disregard the truth so blatantly can also not be trusted to host a safe and secure World Cup.\n\nAnd then there is the wider picture. Thirty-two people died in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody in 2025 alone. The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom dedicated to tracking US gun violence, reports that immigration officers shot at people 19 times since the start of the crackdown – figures it assumes are an undercount. These include three killings in 2025, now up to at least five with the Minnesota deaths. Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has resulted in more detentions of people with no criminal record than any other category – despite its stated aim of ridding the country of criminals and claimed successes in doing so. The raids resulting in all of this have largely targeted Democratic-leaning metro areas – which 10 of the 11 US World Cup host cities are (the Dallas metroplex being the one outlier). Yet “the most important message that football can convey right now is one of peace and unity,” Fifa president Gianni Infantino said last year.\n\nHow can soccer do that when its showpiece event is in a country led by an administration intent on division? A country that has captured a foreign leader, possibly in violation of international law. A country that has threatened supposed allies with military action over control of a foreign territory. A country that has picked seemingly endless fights, including with its World Cup cohosts – the very countries it’s meant to be standing alongside and welcoming the world’s soccer fans.\n\nAre these the actions of a safe country, prepared to handle an influx of foreign visitors? Is this the kind of place you’d expect someone would want to spend many thousands of dollars to visit, even before they’ve ponied up for the games themselves? I can’t believe I’m about to say this, but I sympathise with Sepp Blatter on this one.\n\nThere have been discussions of a boycott in some form; a mild clamor, if that. If that actually happens among enough countries, Fifa’s hand could be forced. But as justified as that would be, that’s hard to even imagine. Holding World Cups in autocratic or destructive countries is nothing new. A boycott would mean revenue lost and a schedule that will be near-impossible to reconfigure. And there’s a feeling at soccer’s highest levels that, no matter which government Fifa cosies up to, the sport itself will escape unscathed.\n\n“With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them,” Concacaf president Victor Montagliani said last year at a conference. “Football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans.”\n\nBut in the meantime, football’s main event is at least partly under this administration’s control. Trump himself said last year that if cities are deemed to be too dangerous, or otherwise unfit for hosting, “We’re going to move the event to some place where it’s going to be appreciated and safe.”\n\nTrump, of course, meant moving World Cup matches to other US cities. But it would be hard to argue if the World Cup was moved out of the US entirely.",

        "selftext": "As soon as the visit came to an end, Staehling committed to Michigan, enrolled in classes and began participating in offseason workouts under new U-M head coach Kyle Whittingham.\n\n“It was essentially a one-way ticket,” Staehling said. “I came down here with a suitcase, a backpack and some dreams. Things have been going a million miles an hour, but I’m truly grateful for it. Everyone here has been extremely nice. The culture is great. The new coaching staff has been great. It’s been a blast. I’m super happy and pumped I’m here.”\n\n... “The professors here are so nice,” Staehling said. “They are making class so awesome. The workouts have been good. The staff is doing excellent work. They are bringing the juice for sure. Everything we are doing is with intention. It’s cool because I’m not used to eight strength coaches in one weight room. I’m used to three or four and sometimes two. It’s an adjustment as far as resources go. I’m just so thankful for this opportunity.”\n\n... “NDSU had a really strong culture and some really good people,” Staehling said. “It was definitely a hard place to leave. I wanted to find a place with a similar culture. I’m used to toughness, accountability, grittiness and hard work. That’s in my blood. Michigan is just like that. I felt that right away when I got here. Michigan is the winningest program in history. It’s hard-nosed football. I just love it.”\n\n... “(Kyle Whittingham, Alex Wittingham, and Jay Hill) are class acts,” Staehling said. “I can just tell from having conversations with them that they want the best for you and are going to push you. They know ball. I’m excited to soak up all of the information. I’m going to be a sponge. They are fantastic coaches. Everything I just said came from just a couple of conversations. That speaks volumes.”\n\n... “I’m a gritty football player,” Staehling said. “I’m going to spring to the ball every single time. I’m going to come downhill, fill the gap and hit someone really hard. I will overcommunicate. I feel like I show on my film that I get everybody on the same page as a MIKE. I define my play as gritty and smart. I’m a hard worker. I want to get more athletic here and showcase that a little bit more.”\n\n... “My vision for the team is to win a national championship,” Staehling said. “But you can’t do that without grinding and putting in the work every single day. I pride myself in being a leader. I want to be someone that guys can lean on. I was a leader at NDSU. I want to do that here. I want to dominate at the role I have. The ultimate goal is to start and put my best foot forward every single day.”",

Lloyd later became the first Black assistant coach for the Pistons. The following is from NBA.COM\n\nHe would finish his NBA playing career with the Detroit Pistons, playing two seasons, 1958-59 and 1959-60, with the team.\n\nBut Lloyd wasn’t finished with the NBA after his playing days…and as it turned out, he wasn’t finished as a pioneer, either. In 1968, Lloyd became the first African-American assistant coach in the NBA, working for the Detroit Pistons and in 1971, he became the second African-American head coach and first African-American bench coach (in 1967 Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics was the first ever head coach, but he was also a player-coach) again with the Detroit Pistons.\n\nAs a coach, he tutored Pistons greats, and future Hall of Famers Dave Bing and Bob Lanier. He later became a scout and discovered the likes of Willis Reed, Earl “The Pearl” Monroe, Ray Scott and Wally Jones.\n\nLater, after playing and coaching Lloyd would continue to influence those in the Detroit area. He worked as job-placement administrator for the Detroit Public Schools in the 1970s and 1980s and later, his former player Dave Bing would ask him to serve as a community liaison with Bing Steel in 1990s. On September 5, 2003 Earl Lloyd was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.",
