Because the NFL expanded to a 7-team playoff format in 2020, Rivers was able to complete the \"Rainbow\" of seeding. He has literally entered the playoffs as every possible seed from 1 to 7 exactly once.\n\n2006 | San Diego Chargers | 14-2 | #1 Seed\n\n2009 | San Diego Chargers | 13-3 | #2 Seed\n\n2007 | San Diego Chargers | 11-5 | #3 seed\n\n2008 | San Diego Chargers | 8-8 | #4 Seed\n\n2018 | L.A.

        "selftext": "With their loss last night, the Colts will continue the streak of not winning the historically bad AFC South since 2014. Even with Andrew Luck, prime TY Hilton, and MVP Candidate Jonathan Taylor, the Colts have failed to win the AFC South since their blowout AFC Championship loss to the Patriots in 2014, which prompted the “Deflategate” scandal. A short history, mostly from memory. \n\nIn 2015, the Colts officially played more seasons in Indianapolis than their original city of Baltimore. The hopes were high, with them coming off of a devasting loss to the Patriots in the AFC Championship game, the Colts were poised to make another run deep in the playoffs. They started off the season 0-2, and then picked up 3 back to back wins against their AFCS rivals, followed by 3 back to back to back losses, dropping them to 3-4. In a week 9 win against the Broncos, Andrew Luck suffered a lacerated kidney, sidelining him for the remainder of the season. The Matt Hasselback-led Colts finished 8-8 behind the 9-7 Texans.\n\nIn 2016, Luck returned and Hasselback finally retired. Hopes were once again high, Again, they dropped their first two games and would win pretty much every other game throughout the season. Luck tried, but the terrible Colts defense held the team back. For the first time in team history, they got swept by the Houston Texans. The Colts finished 8-8 again, finishing 3^(rd) in the division behind the 9-7 Texans and 9-7 Titans. Andrew Luck threw for 4240 yards, with 1448 of them going to T.Y. Hilton, but they missed the playoffs and fired their GM Ryan Grigson after a disappointing season. Luck was sacked a ridiculously high 44 times during the season.\n\n2017 saw the Colts starting off the season with Luck in IR due to an snowboarding accident aggravating a sprained AC joint in his throwing should which required surgery. The Colts had to play without Luck for the entire season, instead relying on Jacoby Brissett. The Colts were swept by both the Titans, and the Jaguars, but managed to beat the Texans both times they played. They finished the season 4-12, and fired coach Chuck Pagano after an awful season. They finished 3^(rd) in the AFCS after the Texans dropped 6 straight to end the season.\n\nAfter an awful 2017 without their star QB, Luck returned to fanfare in the 2018 season. During the off-season, the Colts hired Eagles offensive coordinator Frank Reich. There was a lot of offseason drama with the Colts coaching search, as they had intended to, and announced, the hiring of Patriots OC Josh McDaniels, who then abruptly withdrew his acceptance of the job the next day. Rumor was that, after Jim Irsay visited the McDaniel household, behaved awkwardly, and spent an excessive amount of time in their bathroom, Mrs. McDaniels urged him to reconsider the position. Either way, the Colts hired Frank Reich, and dropped 5 out of the first 6 games including their first game against the Cincinnati Bengals (noticing a pattern for the Colts first game of the season?) Reich righted the ship, and the Colts finished the final 9 games of the season with on 1 loss. They finished 10-6, behind the 11-5 Texans. Luck threw for another 4500 yards and T.Y. Hilton had 1270 on the year. They beat the Texans for the second time that season in the wildcard round of the playoffs, before eventually falling to the Chiefs in the divisional round. This was the last time the Colts have won a playoff game.\n\nColts, again, looked to improve on their previous season. The draft class from the previous year were progressing nicely, with G Quenton Nelson and LB Shaquille Leonard getting All-Pros as rookies. During and unassuming pre-season game, Adam Shefter broke the news of Andrew Luck’s retirement from the NFL 2 weeks before the season started. Luck was on the sidelines of the game, and left Lucas Oil stadium to boos from his own fans, who had learned of his sudden retirement while in the stands. The Colts had to, again, rely on Jacoby Brissett. They dropped their first game (of course), but won 5 of their next 6. They would eventually finish 7-9, and finish behind the 10-6 Texans and 9-7 Titans.\n\nAfter Luck’s retirement, the Colts signed Philip Rivers as their starting QB. Frank Reich was his QB coach for the Chargers previously, so reuniting them would hopefully work out. The Colts dropped their first game(surprise surprise) to the Jaguars, who lost every other game of the season after their own embarrassing “Not satisfied with 1-0” social media post. The Colts finished 11-5, sweeping the Texans, but splitting with the Titans and Jags. They almost missed the playoffs, but that year the NFL expanded the playoffs to 7 teams per conference, so they got the 7^(th) seed after finishing 2^(nd) in the division behind the 11-5 Titans, eventually falling to the Bills in the Wildcard round. Philip Rivers announced his retirement at the end of the season.\n\n2021 saw the Colts without a QB again, so they traded for former Eagles darling Carson Wentz. Frank Reich returned as head coach, and Chris Ballard continued as GM. Wentz looked hapless most of the season, frequently trying to play “hero ball”,  which mostly led to tragedy. The Colts, of course, lost their season opener. With a “win and in” situation in week 18 at the 2-14 Jaguars, the Colts collapsed, losing 11-26 and missing the playoffs. They finished 2^(nd) in the division behind the 1^(st) seed 12-5 Tennessee Titans.\n\nAnother year, another new QB. The Colts traded a third round pick for Matt Ryan during the offseason. Surprisingly, the Colts did not lose their first game of the season, instead, they hilariously tied the Houston Texans, and then promptly lost to the Jaguars in Jacksonville the next week. After going 3-5-1 in the first 9 games, Frank Reich was fired by the Colts, who hired Jeff Saturday as their interim QB. They dropped their last 7 games, including blowing the biggest lead in NFL history to the Vikings, after being up 33-0 at half time. The Colts finished 3^(rd) in the AFCS, after the Titans collapsed in the second half of the season, and the Jaguars taking the division with a 9-8 record.\n\nThe Colts had the 4^(th) draft pick following the departure of Matt Ryan, and they chose Anthony Richardson after the Panthers took Bryce Young and the Texans drafted C.J. Stroud and Will Anderson in back to back picks. The Colts hired Shane Steichen and signed QB Gardner Minshew during the offseason. The NFL schedule gods decided to give the Colts a break, and give them their traditional first game loss and Jacksonville loss in the same week, so of course they lost week 1. Minshew had a decent year after Anthony Richardson struggled with injury, but they finished 3^(rd) in the division with a record of 9-8. The Texans made the playoffs with a win over the Colts in week 18, improving to 10-7 while the Colts, once again, were exited early.\n\nMinshew signed with the Raiders over the off-season, so the Colts brought in the Elite Dragon, Joe Flacco as backup to Anthony Richardson. The Colts started 0-2 again, but won the next 2. Richardson got hurt early in the week 4 game against the Steelers, where Joe Flacco came back for revenge against his former rival. The rest of the season was marred by many ups and downs, with another loss in Jacksonville in week 5. The Colts finished 8-9, 2^(nd) in the AFCS behind the 10-7 Texans.\n\nThis year, the Colts signed Daniel Jones in the off-season. Colts fans were the least optimistic about the season, though they finally snapped their Week 1 losing streak, beating the Dolphins 33-8. Daniel Jones looked like a Manning (goofy face an all) over the next several weeks. Dropping games only to the Rams and Steelers. The Colts curse would eventually catch up to them. The cracks in the team started to show, Anthony Ricahrdson had a freak accident where a workout band snapped, hitting him in the face and breaking his orbital bone, almost making him lose his eye. Daniel Jones suffered an Achilles’ tear after playing injured with a broken fibula. With yesterday’s loss to the 49ers, it is mathematically impossible for the Colts to win the AFCS for the 11^(th) season in a row.\n\nFunny enough, the Colts have not finished 4^(th) in the AFCS since the 2011 season, when they got the first overall pick, and drafted Andrew Luck.",
